0,1) Catabolism of Fibromodulin in Developmental Rudiment and Pathologic Articular Cartilage Demonstrates Novel Roles for MMP-13 and ADAMTS-4 in C-terminal Processing of SLRPs.,"[['1) [ Cartilage regeneration requires a balance of anabolic and catabolic processes. To examine the susceptibility of fibromodulin (FMOD) and lumican (LUM) to degradation by MMP-13, ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5, the three major degradative proteinases in articular cartilage, in cartilage development and in osteoarthritis (OA). Immunolocalization of FMOD and LUM in fetal foot and adult knee cartilages using an FMOD matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-13 neoepitope antibody (TsYG11) and C-terminal anti-FMOD (PR184) and anti-LUM (PR353) antibodies. The in vitro digestion of knee cartilage with MMP-13, A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease with Thrompospondin motifs (ADAMTS)-4 and ADAMTS-5, to assess whether FMOD and LUM fragments observed in Western blots of total knee replacement specimens could be generated. Normal ovine articular cartilage explants were cultured with interleukin (IL)-1 and Oncostatin-M (OSM) ± PGE3162689, a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor, to assess FMOD, LUM and collagen degradation. FMOD and LUM were immunolocalized in metatarsal and phalangeal fetal rudiment cartilages and growth plates. Antibody TsYG11 localized MMP-13-cleaved FMOD in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of the metatarsal growth plates. FMOD was more prominently localized in the superficial cartilage of normal and fibrillated zones in OA cartilage. TsYG11-positive FMOD was located deep in the cartilage samples. Ab TsYG11 identified FMOD fragmentation in Western blots of normal and fibrillated cartilage extracts and total knee replacement cartilage. The C-terminal anti-FMOD, Ab PR-184, failed to identify FMOD fragmentation due to C-terminal processing. The C-terminal LUM, Ab PR-353, identified three LUM fragments in OA cartilages. In vitro digestion of human knee cartilage with MMP-13, ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 generated FMOD fragments of 54, 45 and 32 kDa similar to in blots of OA cartilage; LUM was less susceptible to fragmentation. Ab PR-353 detected N-terminally processed LUM fragments of 39, 38 and 22 kDa in 65⁻80-year-old OA knee replacement cartilage. FMOD and LUM were differentially processed in MMP-13, ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 digestions. FMOD was susceptible to degradation by MMP-13, ADAMTS-4 and to a lesser extent by ADAMTS-5; however, LUM was not. MMP-13-cleaved FMOD in metatarsal and phalangeal fetal rudiment and growth plate cartilages suggested roles in skeletogenesis and OA pathogenesis. Explant cultures of ovine cartilage stimulated with IL-1/OSM ± PGE3162689 displayed GAG loss on day 5 due to ADAMTS activity. However, by day 12, the activation of proMMPs occurred as well as the degradation of FMOD and collagen. These changes were inhibited by PGE3162689, partly explaining the FMOD fragments seen in OA and the potential therapeutic utility of PGE3162689.']]"
1,2) Molecular Recognition of the Catalytic Zinc(II) Ion in MMP-13: Structure-Based Evolution of an Allosteric Inhibitor to Dual Binding Mode Inhibitors with Improved Lipophilic Ligand Efficiencies.,"[[""2) ['Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a class of zinc dependent endopeptidases which play a crucial role in a multitude of severe diseases such as cancer and osteoarthritis. We employed MMP-13 as the target enzyme for the structure-based design and synthesis of inhibitors able to recognize the catalytic zinc ion in addition to an allosteric binding site in order to increase the affinity of the ligand. Guided by molecular modeling, we optimized an initial allosteric inhibitor by addition of linker fragments and weak zinc binders for recognition of the catalytic center. Furthermore we improved the lipophilic ligand efficiency (LLE) of the initial inhibitor by adding appropriate zinc binding fragments to lower the clogP values of the inhibitors, while maintaining their potency. All synthesized inhibitors showed elevated affinity compared to the initial hit, also most of the novel inhibitors displayed better LLE. Derivatives with carboxylic acids as the zinc binding fragments turned out to be the most potent inhibitors (compound 3 (ZHAWOC5077): IC50 = 134 nM) whereas acyl sulfonamides showed the best lipophilic ligand efficiencies (compound 18 (ZHAWOC5135): LLE = 2.91).

2,3) RECK suppresses interleukin-17/TRAF3IP2-mediated MMP-13 activation and human aortic smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation.,"[[""3) ['Sustained inflammation and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation contribute to vascular occlusive/proliferative disorders. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a proinflammatory cytokine that signals mainly via TRAF3 Interacting Protein 2 (TRAF3IP2), an upstream regulator of various critical transcription factors, including AP-1 and NF-κB. Reversion\\xa0inducing cysteine\\xa0rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) is a membrane-anchored MMP inhibitor. Here we investigated whether IL-17A/TRAF3IP2 signaling promotes MMP-13-dependent human aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration, and determined whether RECK overexpression blunts these responses. Indeed, IL-17A treatment induced (a) JNK, p38 MAPK, AP-1, NF-κB, and CREB activation, (b) miR-21 induction, (c) miR-27b and miR-320 inhibition, (d) MMP-13 expression and activation, (e) RECK suppression, and (f) SMC migration and proliferation, all in a TRAF3IP2-dependent manner. In fact, gain of TRAG3IP2 function, by itself, induced MMP-13 expression and activation, and RECK suppression. Furthermore, treatment with recombinant MMP-13 stimulated SMC migration in part via ERK activation. Importantly, RECK gain-of-function attenuated MMP-13 activity without affecting its mRNA or protein levels, and inhibited IL-17A- and MMP-13-induced SMC migration. These results indicate that increased MMP-13 and decreased RECK contribute to IL-17A-induced TRAF3IP2-dependent SMC migration and proliferation, and suggest that TRAF3IP2 inhibitors or RECK inducers have the potential to block the progression of neointimal thickening in hyperplastic vascular diseases.']""]]"
3,4) Oxidative stress-dependent MMP-13 activity underlies glucose neurotoxicity.,"[['4) [ A complication of diabetes is neuropathy, a condition of sensory axon degeneration that originates in the epidermis. The mechanisms remain unknown but reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in this condition. In this study, we assessed the role of ROS and a candidate downstream target, MMP-13 in glucose-induced sensory axon degeneration in zebrafish and mice. The effects of glucose on metabolism and sensory axon degeneration were assessed using qPCR and live imaging. ROS were analyzed using pentafluorobenzene-sulfonyl fluorescein and activation of the NF-κB stress response was determined using Tg(NF-κB:GFP) zebrafish. The role of MMP-13 and ROS in glucose-dependent axon degeneration was determined in zebrafish following treatment with the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine and the MMP-13 inhibitor, DB04760. Neuropathic mice fed on a high-fat/high-sugar diet were treated with the MMP-13 inhibitor, CL-82198 to assess sensory recovery. Glucose treatment of zebrafish induced metabolic changes that resemble diabetes. Sensory axon degeneration was mediated by ROS-induced MMP-13 and prevented upon antioxidant treatment or MMP-13 inhibition. MMP-13 inhibition also reversed neuropathy in diabetic mice. We demonstrate that zebrafish are suitable to study glucose-induced neurotoxicity. Given the effects in zebrafish and mice, MMP-13 inhibition may be beneficial in the treatment of human diabetic neuropathy.']]"
4,5) ADAM8 promotes chondrosarcoma cell migration and invasion by activating the NF-κB/MMP-13 signaling axis.,"[[""5) ['ADAM8 is reported to promote extracellular matrix degradation to provide conditions for tumor metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism of ADAM8 in modulating chondrosarcoma (CHS) metastasis remains unclear. We used two human CHS cell lines SW1353 and HCS-2/8 to analyze the expression profiles of ADAM8 in CHS cells compared with the normal chondrocytes. An important proteolytic enzyme MMP-13 was detected as a marker for extracellular matrix degradation in chondrocytes. Then, by silencing or overexpressing ADAM8, the effects on cell migration and invasion in SW1353 and HCS-2/8, and the downstream signal transduction pathways were evaluated. ADAM8 and MMP-13 were highly expressed, and the NF-κB pathway was activated in SW1353 and HCS-2/8 cells. Silencing ADAM8 significantly reduced the ability of cell migration and invasion, and blocked the NF-κB signaling pathway through IκBα and p65 dephosphorylation, leading to reduced NF-κB transcription activity and decreased MMP-13 expression. ADAM8 overexpression promoted these processes, which, however, were reversed by an inhibitor Bay 11-7085. Our data showed a novel regulation mechanism for ADAM8 in promoting CHS migration and invasion by activating the NF-κB/MMP-13 signaling axis. Modulation of their levels may serve as potential targets in the treatment of CHS and even other cartilage diseases.']""]]"
5,6) Protective effects of Nebivolol against interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced type II collagen destruction mediated by matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13).,"[[""6) ['The pathological progression of osteoarthritis (OA) involves degradation of articular cartilage matrix. Type II collagen is the main component of cartilage matrix, which is degraded by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β mediated by MMP-13. Nebivolol, a licensed drug used for the treatment of hypertension in clinics, displays its anti-inflammatory capacity in various conditions. However, whether Nebivolol has a protective effect on cartilage matrix degradation has not been reported before. In this study, we investigated the effects of Nebivolol on regulating the expression of MMP-13 and degradation of type II collagen. Our results indicate that Nebivolol alleviated the increase in gene expression, protein expression, and activity of MMP-13 induced by IL-1β. Importantly, IL-1β strikingly reduced the levels of type II collagen in cell culture supernatants, which was reversed by treatment with Nebivolol in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, Nebivolol was found to alleviate the increased levels of phosphorylated IκBα and reduced levels of total IκBα induced by IL-1β, which subsequently mitigated p65 nuclear translocation and the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Furthermore, our results indicated that IL-1β treatment resulted in a significant increase in expression of the transcriptional factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) at both the mRNA and protein levels, which was significantly ameliorated by treatment with Nebivolol. The combination of these findings suggests that Nebivolol can potentially be applied in human OA treatment.']""]]"
6,"7) Retinal MMP-12, MMP-13, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 expression in murine experimental retinal detachment.","[['7) [ Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors play a role in the pathobiology of retinal detachment (RD) and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Proliferative vitreoretinopathy is facilitated by chronic retinal detachment and involves excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -13 are important modulators of the ECM which have not been evaluated in RD. The purpose of this study was to investigate the retinal expression of select MMPs, including MMP-12, MMP-13, and associated inhibitors in a murine model of retinal detachment. Transient or chronic retinal detachments (RDs) were induced by subretinal injection of either saline (SA) or hyaluronic acid (HA) in C57BL/6 mice. To confirm that the HA-RD model has features consistent with PVR-like changes, glial activation and subretinal fibrosis were evaluated with immunofluorescence, dilated fundus examination, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Gene expression was quantified by qRT-PCR. Proteins were assayed by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. Hyaluronic acid RD eyes developed gliosis and subretinal fibrosis on dilated exam, SD-OCT, and immunofluorescence analysis. Gene expression of Mmp-12 and Mmp-13, and Timp-1 was strongly upregulated at all time points in RD compared with controls. Timp-2, Mmp-2, and Mmp-9 expression was modest. Hyaluronic acid RDs exhibited more MMP and TIMP expression than SA-RDs. MMP-12, -13, and TIMP-1 proteins were elevated in RDs compared with controls. Immunohistochemistry revealed moderate to strong MMP-13 levels in subretinal space macrophages. Fibrosis can develop in the HA-RD model. There is an upregulation of select MMPs that may modulate the wound healing process following RD.']]"
7,"8) Molecular modelling studies of quinazolinone derivatives as MMP-13 inhibitors by QSAR, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations techniques.","[[""8) ['Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) is an attractive drug target for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). In this study, a series of quinazolinone derivatives as MMP-13 inhibitors were firstly systematically studied using QSAR, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The reliable CoMFA (<i>q</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.646, <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.992, <i>R</i><sub>pred</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.829) and CoMSIA (<i>q</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.704, <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.992, <i>R</i><sub>pred</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.839) models were constructed and verified by the Topomer CoMFA model. Results of contour maps indicated that the electrostatic, hydrophobic and H-bond acceptor fields primarily influenced the activity of MMP-13 inhibitors in the models. Several key residues (Ala238, Thr245, Thr247, Met253, Asn215 and Lys140) were identified as important factors to improve the activity and stability of the inhibitor through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction. Based on these results, eight novel quinazolinones (<b>D1-D8</b>) were further designed. Additionally, all designed compounds showed good pharmacokinetic properties by ADMET predictions. Compounds <b>D3</b> and <b>D8</b> exhibited excellent predictive activity, and the 10 ns MD simulations analysis revealed that the hydrogen bonding interaction with residues (Ser250 and Gly248) was enhanced, and the small group in R2 and U-shaped conformation was of pivotal importance. These results provided strong guidance for the discovery and design of novel potential MMP-13 inhibitors.']""]]"
8,9) Effects of selective MMP-13 inhibition in squamous cell carcinoma depend on estrogen.,"[[""9) ['Matrix metalloproteinases like MMP-13 cleave and remodel the extracellular matrix and thereby play a crucial role in tumor progression in vivo. Using a highly selective inhibitor to block MMP-13 protein activity, we demonstrate a striking inhibitory effect on invasive tumor growth and vascularization in murine skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Therapy outcome critically depends on animal age in C57Bl/6 mice and was successful in old female but not in young female mice. Treatment success was recovered by ovariectomy in young and abolished by 17ß-estradiol supplementation in old mice, suggesting a hormone dependent inhibitor effect. Responsiveness of the tumorigenic keratinocytes BDVII and fibroblasts to 17ß-estradiol was confirmed in vitro, where MMP-13 inhibitor treatment led to a reduction of cell invasion and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release. This correlated well with a less invasive and vascularized tumor in treated mice in vivo. 17ß-estradiol supplementation also reduced invasion and VEGF release in vitro with no additional reduction on MMP-13 inhibitor treatment. This suggests that low 17ß-estradiol levels in old mice in vivo lead to enhanced MMP-13 levels and VEGF release, allowing a more effective inhibitor treatment compared to young mice. In our study, we present a strong link between lower estrogen levels in old female mice, an elevated MMP-13 level, which results in a more effective MMP-13 inhibitor treatment in fibroblasts and SCC cells in vitro and in vivo.']""]]"
9,10) Inhibition of MMP-13 prevents diet-induced obesity in mice and suppresses adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.,"[[""10) ['Adipose tissue remodeling by the matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) is critical for tissue hypertrophy and obesity. MMP-13 is an important protein that is highly expressed in adipose tissue but whose potential role in adipose tissue expansion is poorly characterized. We investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of MMP-13 with a selective inhibitor, CP-544439, on adipose tissue mass in mice on a high fat diet, and determined the effect of the inhibitor during in vitro adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. CP-544439 was administered for 6 weeks to mice on a high fat diet. Body adiposity and glucose tolerance was determined. Differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes were also treated with the inhibitor for a maximum of 8 days and adipogenesis assessed. Treatment of mice with the inhibitor resulted in reduction in body adiposity and improvement in glucose clearance. Histological examination of epididymal adipose showed reduced adipocyte hypertrophy accompanied by increased staining for collagen in the inhibitor treated mice. Treatment of differentiating 3T3-L1 cells with the inhibitor resulted in reduced adipocyte differentiation. Knockdown of MMP-13 using small interfering RNA in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells reduced adipocyte differentiation indicated by reduced expression of PPARγ. These results suggest that MMP-13 may play a major role in adipose development and its inhibition could be a potential strategy to prevent obesity.']""]]"
10,"11) PAI-1, a target gene of miR-143, regulates invasion and metastasis by upregulating MMP-13 expression of human osteosarcoma.","[[""11) ['Despite recent improvements in the therapy for osteosarcoma, 30-40% of osteosarcoma patients die of this disease, mainly due to its lung metastasis. We have previously reported that intravenous injection of miR-143 significantly suppresses lung metastasis of human osteosarcoma cells (143B) in a mouse model. In this study, we examined the biological role and mechanism of miR-143 in the metastasis of human osteosarcoma cells. We identified plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as a direct target gene of miR-143. To determine the role of PAI-1 in human osteosarcoma cells, siRNA was transfected into 143B cells for knockdown of PAI-1 expression. An in vitro study showed that downregulation of PAI-1 suppressed cell invasion activity, but not proliferation. Moreover, injection of PAI-1 siRNA into a primary lesion in the osteosarcoma mouse model inhibited lung metastasis compared to control siRNA-injected mice, without influencing the proliferative activity of the tumor cells. Subsequent examination using 143B cells revealed that knockdown of PAI-1 expression resulted in downregulation of the expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), which is also a target gene of miR-143 and a proteolytic enzyme that regulates tumor-induced osteolysis. Immunohistochemical analysis using clinical samples showed that higher miR-143 expressing cases showed poor expression of PAI-1 in the primary tumor cells. All such cases belonged to the lung metastasis-negative group. Moreover, the frequency of lung metastasis-positive cases was significantly higher in PAI-1 and MMP-13 double-positive cases than in PAI-1 or MMP-13 single-positive or double-negative cases (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). These results indicated that PAI-1, a target gene of miR-143, regulates invasion and lung metastasis via enhancement of MMP-13 expression and secretion in human osteosarcoma cells, suggesting that these molecules could be potential therapeutic target genes for preventing lung metastasis in osteosarcoma patients.']""]]"
11,12) RANTES/CCL5 Induces Collagen Degradation by Activating MMP-1 and MMP-13 Expression in Human Rheumatoid Arthritis Synovial Fibroblasts.,"[[""12) ['Regulated on activation, normal T expressed, and secreted (RANTES)/CC ligand 5 (CCL5) participates in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis by facilitating leukocyte infiltration, however, its other pathological functions are not fully defined in RA. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of RANTES/CCL5 on tissue degrading enzymes matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and MMP-13 expression and its contribution to the progressive joint damage by RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). Our results showed that RANTES/CCL5 dose dependently induced MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression in monolayers and three-dimensional (3D) micromass of human RASFs, which correlated with an increase in collagenase activity. This activation by RANTES/CCL5 was observed in RASF, but not in osteoarthritis SFs (OASFs). Evaluation of the signaling events showed that RANTES/CCL5 selectively activated PKCδ, JNK, and ERK proteins to induce MMP expression in human RASFs. Pretreatment with a functional antagonist (Met-RANTES) or heparinase III [an enzyme that selectively digests heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs)] completely abrogated RANTES/CCL5-induced MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression. Interestingly, the inhibition of RANTES/CCL5 using small-interfering RNA approach reduced the ability of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) to induce MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression, asserting its mediatory role in tissue remodeling. In the inhibitor study, only the selective inhibition of HSPGs or PKCδ, ERK, and JNK markedly inhibited RANTES/CCL5-induced MMP-1 and MMP-13 production. Circular dichroism spectroscopy results demonstrated the degradation of collagen triple-helical structure upon exposure to the conditioned media from RANTES/CCL5 stimulated RASFs, which was reverted by a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor (GM6001). These findings suggest that RANTES/CCL5 not only upregulates MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression by partly utilizing HSPGs and/or PKCδ-JNK/ERK pathways but also mediates IL-1β-induced MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression.']""]]"
12,13) Salubrinal Suppresses IL-17-Induced Upregulation of MMP-13 and Extracellular Matrix Degradation Through the NF-kB Pathway in Human Nucleus Pulposus Cells.,"[[""13) ['Matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) plays an important role in the process of pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). This study examined the effect of IL-17 on the regulation of MMP-13 and the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the intervertebral disc (IVD). We then examined whether salubrinal, a known inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylation, inhibited the IL-17-induced changes mentioned above. Furthermore, we demonstrated a potential therapeutic role for salubrinal in alleviating the chronic inflammatory-dependent degenerative state commonly observed in IDD. After inflammatory distress with IL-17, RT-PCR and western blot were employed to investigate the expression of MMP-13, collagen type II (COL2A1), collagen type I (COL1A1), and aggrecan (ACAN) in nucleus pulpous (NP) tissue. Activation of the NF-kB pathway was measured by western blot and immunocytochemistry following IL-17 treatment. We also examine the level of eIF2α phosphorylation after IL-17 treatment with or without salubrinal. Then, we investigated interactions of the NF-kB pathway to eIF2α phosphorylation. Moreover, we employed salubrinal and a specific inhibitor of NF-kB (BAY11-7082) to evaluate their effects on IL-17-driven regulation of MMP-13 and the ECM, as well as on the activation of NF-kB. The results showed that IL-17 increased the production of MMP-13 and decreased expression of COL2A1 and ACAN via the NF-kB pathway. Either IL-17 or salubrinal increased the level of eIF2α phosphorylation, but the effects of BAY11-7082 on the level of p-eIF2α were not detectable. BAY11-7082 and salubrinal significantly suppressed IL-17-driven intervertebral disc degeneration. Furthermore, salubrinal produced stronger effects than BAY11-7082. These results imply the potential involvement of IL-17 in IDD through activation of NF-kB signaling, which successively upregulated the expression of MMP-13 and led to the degradation of the ECM. Furthermore, salubrinal can inhibit this process through inhibition of NF-kB activation that is not directly linked to eIF2α phosphorylation, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in IDD.']""]]"

Our results also revealed that helenalin, an NF-κB pathway inhibitor, decreased the expression of P2X7R, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, SP, PGE2 and MMP-13, which was induced by MIA, in the knee cartilage tissues of rats with OA. On the whole, our findings suggest that P2X7R regulates the MMP-13 and NF-κB pathways in cartilage tissue and mediate OA-induced pain and inflammation.']""]]"

Sham group only underwent the resection of a bit fat; OVX group underwent bilateral ovariectomy; E2 group was treated with E2 based on OVX; ICI group was treated with E2 and pretreated ICI182780 (inhibitor of the estrogen receptor) based on OVX. Radiography, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were applied to detect the apoptosis characteristics of intervertebral disc cells. Radiographs showed marked intervertebral disc narrowing and HE staining showed typical apoptosis characteristics of intervertebral disc cells in OVX, which were reversed by E2. Furthermore, the results of IHC, Western blot and qRT-PCR revealed that OVX-induced IVDD was protected by E2 through decreasing the expression of caspase-3 and intracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-3 and MMP-13, while increasing the expression of collagen Type II.

Fifty-one patients had periodontitis whereas 39 were periodontally healthy. Saliva and serum samples were analyzed with immunofluorometric, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot. Results were statistically analyzed with independent t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Bonferroni corrections, and regression analyses. MMP-13 was not detected in serum, but in saliva, higher values were found among the periodontally healthy compared with periodontitis subjects (0.32\\xa0±\\xa00.26 vs. 0.21\\xa0±\\xa00.23\\xa0ng/ml, p\\xa0<\\xa0.05).

No statistically significant differences between groups were found in serum and saliva values of MMP-8, MMP-9, and TIMP-1. Contrary to our hypothesis, no statistically significant differences between patients with and without periodontitis were seen in MMP-8, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 values. However, higher MMP-13 concentrations in saliva were associated with female gender and higher clinical attachment loss. Metabolism of MMP-13 may thus have some gender implications in periodontitis.']""]]"

In summary, this work presented that IL-1β maybe induced apoptosis of rat nucleus pulposus cells, which was resisted by 17β-estradiol by down-regulating MMP-3 and MMP-13 via a mitochondrial pathway. This research provides a novel insight into the anti-apoptotic effect of 17β-estradiol on IL-1β-induced cytotoxicity, and may potentially lead to a better understanding of the clinical effects of 17β-estradiol, especially in terms of intervertebral disc degeneration.

18,19) MMP-13 is constitutively produced in human chondrocytes and co-endocytosed with ADAMTS-5 and TIMP-3 by the endocytic receptor LRP1.,"[[""19) ['Matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) degrades collagenous extracellular matrix and its aberrant activity associates with diseases such as arthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis and fibrosis. The wide range of MMP-13 proteolytic capacity suggests that it is a powerful, potentially destructive proteinase and thus it has been believed that MMP-13 is not produced in most adult human tissues in the steady state. Present study has revealed that human chondrocytes isolated from healthy adults constitutively express and secrete MMP-13, but that it is rapidly endocytosed and degraded by chondrocytes. Both pro- and activated MMP-13 bind to clusters II and III of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). Domain deletion studies indicated that the hemopexin domain is responsible for this interaction. Binding competition between MMP-13 and ADAMTS-4, -5 or TIMP-3, which also bind to cluster II, further shown that the MMP-13 binding site within cluster II is different from those of ADAMTS-4, -5 or TIMP-3. MMP-13 is therefore co-endocytosed with ADAMTS-5 and TIMP-3 by human chondrocytes. These findings indicate that MMP-13 may play a role on physiological turnover of cartilage extracellular matrix and that LRP1 is a key modulator of extracellular levels of MMP-13 and its internalization is independent of the levels of ADAMTS-4, -5 and TIMP-3.']""]]"

20,21) E2 regulates MMP-13 via targeting miR-140 in IL-1β-induced extracellular matrix degradation in human chondrocytes.,"[['21) [ Estrogen deficiency is closely related to the development of menopausal arthritis. Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) shows a protective effect against the osteoarthritis. However, the underlying mechanism of this protective effect is unknown. This study aimed to determine the role of miR-140 in the estrogen-dependent regulation of MMP-13 in human chondrocytes. Primary human articular chondrocytes were obtained from female OA patients undergoing knee replacement surgery. Normal articular chondrocytes were isolated from the knee joints of female donors after trauma and treated with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Gene expression levels of miR-140, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5 were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). miR-140 levels were upregulated or downregulated by transfecting cells with a miRNA mimic and inhibitor, respectively, prior to treatment with IL-1β. MMP-13 expression was then evaluated by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to verify the interaction between miR-140 and ER. 17-β-estradiol (E2) suppressed MMP-13 expression in human articular chondrocytes. miR-140 expression was upregulated after estrogen treatment. Knockdown of miR-140 expression abolished the inhibitory effect of estrogen on MMP-13. In addition, the estrogen/ER/miR-140 pathway showed an inhibitory effect on IL-1β-induced cartilage matrix degradation. This study suggests that estrogen acts via ER and miR-140 to inhibit the catabolic activity of proteases within the chondrocyte extracellular matrix. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism of menopausal arthritis and indicate that the ER/miR-140 signaling pathway may be a potential target for therapeutic interventions for menopausal arthritis.']]"

The aim of this study is to determine whether autophagy participates in the pathology of AGE-treated chondrocytes and to investigate the exact role of autophagy in AGE-induced cell apoptosis and expression of matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 3 and MMP-13. AGEs induced notable apoptosis that was detected by Annexin V/PI double-staining, and the upregulation of MMP-3 and MMP-13 was confirmed by Western blotting. Autophagy-related proteins were also determined by Western blotting, and chondrocytes were transfected with mCherry-GFP-LC3B-adenovirus to monitor autophagic flux. As a result, autophagy significantly increased in chondrocytes and peaked at 6\\u2009h. Furthermore, rapamycin (RA) attenuated AGE-induced apoptosis and expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 by autophagy activation. In contrast, pretreatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) enhanced the abovementioned effects of AGEs. We therefore demonstrated that autophagy is linked with AGE-related pathology in rat chondrocytes and plays a protective role in AGE-induced apoptosis and expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13.']""]]"

The SCID mouse co-implantation model of RA, the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in mice and the antigen-induced arthritis model (AIA) in rabbits were used. In the SCID mouse co-implantation model, the MMP-13 inhibitor reduced cartilage destruction by 75%.

No significant effects were seen in the AIA model. No toxic effects were seen in all three animal models. Although several MMPs in concert with other proteinases have a role in the process of cartilage destruction, there is a need for highly selective MMP inhibitors to reduce severe side effects that occur with non-specific inhibitors. Significant inhibition of MMP-13 reduced cartilage erosions in two of three tested animal models of RA. These results strongly support the development of this class of drugs to reduce or halt joint destruction in patients with RA.']]"

Recently, numerous reports have demonstrated the impact of sirtuin-1 (Sirt1), which is the NAD-dependent deacetylase, on human aging. It has been demonstrated that Sirt1 induces osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. However, the role of Sirt1 in the OA chondrocytes still remains unknown. We postulated that Sirt1 regulates a hypertrophic chondrocyte lineage and degeneration of articular cartilage through the activation of osteogenic transcriptional activator Runx2 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 in OA chondrocytes. To verify whether sirtuin-1 (Sirt1) regulates chondrocyte activity in OA, we studied expressions of Sirt1, Runx2 and production of MMP-13, and their associations in human OA chondrocytes. The expression of Sirt1 was ubiquitously observed in osteoarthritic chondrocytes; in contrast, Runx2 expressed in the osteophyte region in patients with OA and OA model mice. OA relating catabolic factor IL-1βincreased the expression of Runx2 in OA chondrocytes. OA chondrocytes, which were pretreated with Sirt1 inhibitor, inhibited the IL-1β-induced expression of Runx2 compared to the control. Since the Runx2 is a promotor of MMP-13 expression, Sirt1 inactivation may inhibit the Runx2 expression and the resultant down-regulation of MMP-13 production in chondrocytes. Our findings suggest thatSirt1 may regulate the expression of Runx2, which is the osteogenic transcription factor, and the production of MMP-13 from chondrocytes in OA. Since Sirt1 activity is known to be affected by several stresses, including inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as aging, SIRT may be involved in the development of OA. ']""]]"

High expression levels of TIMP-1 (34-kDa) and TIMP-2 (55-kDa) were detected only in immature and pre-pubertal testes and not in adult testis. Four different forms of TIMP-2 protein were differentially detected in the testes of growing and adult chicken. Using immunohistochemistry we localized both secreted and intracellular forms of MMP-13, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 proteins. These proteins were temporally and spatially distributed in growing and adult testes, and all their expression levels were similar to the expression profile of Western blot results.

28,29) SERPINE2 Inhibits IL-1α-Induced MMP-13 Expression in Human Chondrocytes: Involvement of ERK/NF-κB/AP-1 Pathways.,"[['29) [ Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease, characterized by a progressive loss of articular cartilage.

Members of Serpine family, including plasminogen activator inhibitors have been reported to participate in ECM regulation. The aim of this study was to assess the expression of serpin peptidase inhibitor clade E member 2 (SERPINE2), under basal conditions and in response to increasing doses of IL-1α, in human cultured chondrocytes. We also examined the effects of SERPINE2 on IL-1α-induced MMP-13 expression. For completeness, the signaling pathway involved in this process was also explored. SERPINE2 mRNA and protein expression were evaluated by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis in human T/C-28a2 cell line and human primary chondrocytes. These cells were treated with human recombinant SERPINE2, alone or in combination with IL-1α. ERK 1/2, NFκB and AP-1 activation were assessed by western blot analysis. Human cultured chondrocytes express SERPINE2 in basal condition. This expression increased in response to IL-1α stimulation. In addition, recombinant SERPINE2 induced a clear inhibition of MMP-13 expression in IL-1α-stimulated chondrocytes. This inhibitory effect is likely regulated through a pathway involving ERK 1/2, NF-κB and AP-1. Taken together, these data demonstrate that SERPINE2 might prevent cartilage catabolism by inhibiting the expression of MMP-13, one of the most relevant collagenases, involved in cartilage breakdown in OA.']]"

The left ventricular tissues were dissected out, and hydroxyproline and collagen I contents were detected with ELISA. The expression of MMP-8, MMP-13, and a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in the tissues was measured using real-time PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The shunt operation markedly reduced LVSP and LV ± dp/dtmax, increased LVEDP, hydroxyproline and collagen I contents, as well as the mRNA and protein levels of MMP-8, MMP-13, and TIMP-1 in the left ventricles. Chronic treatment of the shunt operation rats with NaHS effectively prevented the abnormalities in the hemodynamic parameters, hydroxyproline and collagen I contents, and the mRNA and protein levels of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 in the left ventricles. NaHS also prevented the increase of MMP-8 protein expression, but did not affect the increase of mRNA level of MMP-8 in the shunt operation rats.

30,31) Shedding of NG2 by MMP-13 attenuates anoikis.,"[[""31) ['Disruption of cell-matrix interactions can lead to anoikis-apoptosis due to loss of matrix contacts. We previously showed that Nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2) is a novel anoikis receptor. Specifically, overexpression of NG2 leads to anoikis propagation, whereas its suppression leads to anoikis attenuation. Interestingly, NG2 expression decreases in late anoikis, suggesting that NG2 reduction is also critical to this process. Thus, we hypothesized that NG2 undergoes cleavage to curtail anoikis propagation. Further, since matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) cleave cell surface receptors, play a major role in modulating apoptosis, and are associated with death receptor cleavage during apoptosis, we further hypothesized that cleavage of NG2 could be mediated by MMPs to regulate anoikis. Indeed, anoikis conditions triggered release of the NG2 extracellular domain into condition media during late apoptosis, and this coincided with increased MMP-13 expression. Treatment with an MMP-13 inhibitor and MMP-13 siRNA increased anoikis, since these treatments blocked NG2 release. Further, NG2-positive cells exhibited increased anoikis upon MMP-13 inhibition, whereas MMP-13 inhibition did not increase anoikis in NG2-null cells, corroborating that retention of NG2 on the cell membrane is critical for sustaining anoikis, and its cleavage for mediating anoikis attenuation. Similarly, NG2 suppression with siRNA inhibited NG2 release and anoikis. In contrast, MMP-13 overexpression or exogenous MMP-13 reduced anoikis by more effectively shedding NG2. In conclusion, maintenance of NG2 on the cell surface promotes anoikis propagation, whereas its shedding by MMP-13 actions attenuates anoikis. Given that these findings are derived in the context of periodontal ligament fibroblasts, these data have implications for periodontal inflammation and periodontal disease pathogenesis. ']""]]"

FLSs were treated with IL-1beta (10 ng/ml) for 24 h in the presence or absence of PDTC. The level of MMP-1 and MMP-13 increased in response to PDTC in time- and dose-dependent manners in IL-1beta-stimulated FLSs; the expressions of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) decreased in a PDTC concentration-dependent manner. However, PDTC-mediated repression of IL-6 and VEGF expression was not observed in TNF-alpha-stimulated rheumatoid arthritis FLSs. In contrast, other NF-kappaB inhibitors, such as fenofibrate, N-acetylcysteine and MG132, decreased MMP expression in IL-1beta-stimulated FLSs. The stimulatory effect of PDTC on MMP expression was not mimicked by specific inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Treatments with 100 muM PDTC did not inhibit the phosphorylation of p-ERK1/2, p-P38, and p-JNK, or the transnuclear migration of NF-kappaB through degradation of IkappaB-alpha in IL-1beta-stimulated FLSs. These results suggest that the increase of MMP expression may occur in a stimuli-specific manner or by an NF-kappaB independent mechanism.

Upregulation of TNF-α and MMP-13 as well as downregulation of PPARγ were induced by AGEs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The maximum effect was induced by 100 μg/ml AGEs. This effect can be inhibited by anti-RAGE. Pioglitazone dose-dependently inhibited the expression of TNF-α and MMP-13 induced by AGEs, which was combined with the inhibition of nuclear p65 expression. The PPARγ agonist pioglitazone modulates TNF-α and MMP-13 expression in cultured rabbit chondrocytes via NF-κB signaling. It indicates that pioglitazone may have therapeutic potential in OA.']]"
39,40) α11β1 integrin-mediated MMP-13-dependent collagen lattice contraction by fibroblasts: evidence for integrin-coordinated collagen proteolysis.,"[[""40) ['We have previously determined that integrin α11β1 is required on mouse periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts to generate the force needed for incisor eruption. As part of the phenotype of α11(-/-) mice, the incisor PDL (iPDL) is thickened, due to disturbed matrix remodeling. To determine the molecular mechanism behind the disturbed matrix dynamics in the PDL we crossed α11(-/-) mice with the Immortomouse and isolated immortalized iPDL cells. Microarray analysis of iPDL cells cultured inside a 3D collagen gel demonstrated downregulated expression of a number of genes in α11-deficient iPDL cells, including matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and cathepsin K. α11(-/-) iPDL cells in vitro displayed disturbed interactions with collagen I during contraction of attached and floating collagen lattices and furthermore displayed reduced MMP-13 protein expression levels. The MMP-13 specific inhibitor WAY 170523 and the Cathepsin K Inhibitor II both blocked part of the α11 integrin-mediated collagen remodeling. In summary, our data demonstrate that in iPDL fibroblasts the mechanical strain generated by α11β1 integrin regulates molecules involved in collagen matrix dynamics. The positive regulation of α11β1-dependent matrix remodeling, involving MMP-13 and cathepsin K, might also occur in other types of fibroblasts and be an important regulatory mechanism for coordinated extracellular and intracellular collagen turnover in tissue homeostasis.']""]]"

The level of total MMP-1 in RA joint fluids was similar to that of the OA joint fluid. In contrast, the level of total MMP-13 in the RA group was significantly higher than that of the OA group. Among various MMPs (MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-9), only MMP-9 was strongly associated with total MMP-13 in both RA and OA. The level of uPA was also strongly associated with MMP-13 in RA but not OA, while the level of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 was not significantly different between RA and OA. In conclusion, MMP-9 and uPA might be involved in the activation of pro-MMP-13 through unknown mechanisms in arthritic diseases.']""]]"

The BMP-2 siRNA induced a 180% increase in the depth of oral sulcus cavity (P < 0.01) by stimulating the invagination of oral sulcus into the mesenchymal tissues consisting of tongue floor, whereas the recombinant BMP-2 suppressed the process in the organ culture system of mouse embryonic tongue. The BMP-2 siRNA induced a 60% decrease in the expression of TIMP-1 mRNA (P < 0.05) and a drastic decline in TIMP-1 protein was observed around the oral sulcus in the BMP-2 siRNA treated mandibles. The recombinant BMP-2 induced a 220% increases in the expression of TIMP-1 mRNA and the area of the immunostaining for TIMP-1 around the oral sulcus was larger in the mandibles treated with the recombinant BMP-2 than the vehicle. The BMP-2 siRNA induced a 60% increase in the expression of MMP-13 protein and a marked increase in the staining intensity for MMP-13 was observed in the epithelial region of the BMP-2 siRNA treated mandibles. The recombinant BMP-2 induced a 70% decrease in the expression of MMP-13 mRNA and the decrease was mainly observed in the tissues around oral sulcus. The expressions of BMP-2, TIMP-1, and MMP-13 were verified in the tissues around in vivo developing oral sulcus at E11, 12, and 13 by immunohistochemistry. These results suggest that BMP-2 regulates the formation of oral sulcus by altering the balance between TIMP-1 and MMP-13.']""]]"

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) the most potent vasoconstrictor plays a crucial role in migration and metastasis of human cancer cells. We found that treatment of human chondrosarcoma (JJ012 cells) with ET-1 increased migration and expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13. ET-1-mediated cell migration and MMP-13 expression were reduced by pretreatment with inhibitors of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as the NF-κB inhibitor and the IκB protease inhibitor. In addition, ET-1 treatment induced phosphorylation of FAK, PI3K, AKT, and mTOR, and resulted in increased NF-κB-luciferase activity that was inhibited by a specific inhibitor of PI3K, Akt, mTOR, and NF-κB cascades. Taken together, these results suggest that ET-1 activated FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR, which in turn activated IKKα/β and NF-κB, resulting in increased MMP-13 expression and migration in human chondrosarcoma cells.']""]]"

MMP-13 (collagenase 3) is the leading MMP involved in cartilage degradation through its particular ability to cleave type-II collagen and as such plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Here we report the kinetic characterisation of N-O-isopropyl sulfonamido-based hydroxamates, potent inhibitors of MMP-13 and MMP-12, bearing different P1 and P1\' substituents. One of these compounds proved to be a potent (4 ≤ K(i) ≤ 5 nM) slow-binding inhibitor towards MMP-13 and MMP-12, with very favourable low association (10(4) M(-1) s(-1)) and dissociation constants (10(-4) s(-1)). Moreover, this compound exhibited a good selectivity for MMP-13 and MMP-12 over MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-8 and, even to a minor extent, MMP-2. A molecular-docking study carried out using the experimentally-derived X-ray crystal structure of MMP-12 (PDB ID: 3F17) revealed critical hydrogen bonding of the hydroxamate and the sulfonamide moieties with key active site residues. Since also MMP-12 is involved in RA, this MMP-13/MMP-12 dual target inhibitor could be a valid candidate for the treatment of this pathology.""]']]"

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which contributes to organ fibrosis. Four new poricoic acids are identified, poricoic acid ZI, ZJ, ZK, and ZL, as novel MMP inhibitors from edible mushroom Poria cocos. Molecular docking, siRNA techniques, TGF-β1-treated renal cells, and unilateral ureteral obstructed (UUO) mice are used to explore the potential efficacy of the novel MMP inhibitors in mitigating the fibrotic process. Treatment with four poricoic acids downregulates profibrotic protein expression in TGF-β1-induced HK-2 cells. Similar results are observed in NRK-52E and NRK-49F cells, indicating that poricoic acids can suppress EMT. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that poricoic acid ZI (PZI) exerts a stronger inhibitory effect on protein expression and enzymatic activity of MMP-13 than the other three compounds, which is consistent with the docking results. The inhibitory effect of PZI on MMP-13 is partially attenuated by MMP-13 RNAi in HK-2 cells and UUO mice. The findings indicate that as a specific MMP-13 inhibitor, PZI attenuates EMT and renal fibrosis. Therefore, the MMP-13 inhibitor PZI can be a novel therapeutic candidate for limiting EMT and renal fibrosis.']]"

OA cartilage and synovial fluid samples were obtained during total knee arthroplasty. Normal cartilage samples were obtained from intra-articular tumor resections, and normal synovial fluid samples were obtained from healthy volunteers and the contralateral uninjured knee of patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. OA was graded using the Mankin score. Expression of Ihh in synovial fluid was determined by Western blot. Ihh, type X collagen and MMP-13 mRNA were determined by real time PCR. Protein expression of type X collagen and MMP-13 in cartilage samples was analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Chondrocyte size was measured using image analysis. Ihh expression was increased 2.6 fold in OA cartilage and 37% in OA synovial fluid when compared to normal control samples. Increased expression of Ihh was associated with the severity of OA and expression of markers of chondrocyte hypertrophy: type X collagen and MMP-13, and chondocyte size. Chondrocytes were more spherical with increasing severity of OA. There was a significant correlation between Mankin score and cell size (r(2) = 0.80) and Ihh intensity (r(2) = 0.89). Exogenous Ihh induced a 6.8 fold increase of type X collagen and 2.8 fold increase of MMP-13 mRNA expression in cultured chondrocytes. Conversely, knockdown of Ihh by siRNA and Hh inhibitor cyclopamine had the opposite effect. Ihh expression correlates with OA progression and changes in chondrocyte morphology and gene expression consistent with chondrocyte hypertrophy and cartilage degradation seen in OA cartilage. Thus, Ihh may be a potential therapeutic target to prevent OA progression.']]"

In the present study, we investigated the roles of PAI-1 in the effects of IL-1β on the chondrocytes using wild-type and PAI-1-deficient mice. IL-1β significantly elevated PAI-1 mRNA levels in the chondrocytes from wild-type mice.

In vitro, effects of SQDG on the expression of MMP-13, TIMP-1 and C-1 in HSC-T6 stimulated by TGF-beta were measured by Western-blot. The results showed that SQDG significantly decreased the elevated level of C-1 in serum of hepatic fibrosis rats induced by CCl4. Pathological examination showed that SQDG could remarkably alleviate the degree of liver fibrogenesis and formation of pseudolobulus. The results of immunohistochemistry demonstrated that SQDG significantly increased MMP-13 expression and decreased TIMP-1 expression in liver tissues. Furthermore, SQDG (20-160 mg x L(-1)) could facilitate MMP-13 expression, inhibit TIMP-1 expression and significantly inhibit the C-I production of HSC stimulated with TGF-beta1 in vitro. The anti-fibrotic effects of SQDG may be associated with its action of promoting collagen degradation via controlling the levels of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 in liver.']]"

Experimental evaluation of 20 selected candidate compounds verified five novel leads with IC(50) in the low μM range. These newly discovered inhibitors are structurally unrelated to the ones known so far and provide useful scaffolds to develop compounds with more desirable properties. Finally, a first round of structure-based optimization on lead 1 was accomplished and led to an increase in potency of more than 5 fold.']""]]"

52,53) Increase in ALK1/ALK5 ratio as a cause for elevated MMP-13 expression in osteoarthritis in humans and mice.,"[[""53) ['During osteoarthritis (OA) chondrocytes show deviant behavior resembling terminal differentiation of growth-plate chondrocytes, characterized by elevated MMP-13 expression. The latter is also a hallmark for OA. TGF-beta is generally thought to be a protective factor for cartilage, but it has also displayed deleterious effects in some studies. Recently, it was shown that besides signaling via the ALK5 (activin-like kinase 5) receptor, TGF-beta can also signal via ALK1, thereby activating Smad1/5/8 instead of Smad2/3. The Smad1/5/8 route can induce chondrocyte terminal differentiation. Murine chondrocytes stimulated with TGF-beta activated the ALK5 receptor/Smad2/3 route as well as the ALK1/Smad1/5/8 route. In cartilage of mouse models for aging and OA, ALK5 expression decreased much more than ALK1. Thus, the ALK1/ALK5 ratio increased, which was associated with changes in the respective downstream markers: an increased Id-1 (inhibitor of DNA binding-1)/PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) ratio. Transfection of chondrocytes with adenovirus overexpressing constitutive active ALK1 increased MMP-13 expression, while small interfering RNA against ALK1 decreased MMP-13 expression to nondetectable levels. Adenovirus overexpressing constitutive active ALK5 transfection increased aggrecan expression, whereas small interfering RNA against ALK5 resulted in increased MMP-13 expression. Moreover, in human OA cartilage ALK1 was highly correlated with MMP-13 expression, whereas ALK5 correlated with aggrecan and collagen type II expression, important for healthy cartilage. Collectively, we show an age-related shift in ALK1/ALK5 ratio in murine cartilage and a strong correlation between ALK1 and MMP-13 expression in human cartilage. A change in balance between ALK5 and ALK1 receptors in chondrocytes caused changes in MMP-13 expression, thereby causing an OA-like phenotype. Our data suggest that dominant ALK1 signaling results in deviant chondrocyte behavior, thereby contributing to age-related cartilage destruction and OA.']""]]"

CLIP-CHIP® microarrays identified changes in the complete protease and inhibitor expression profile of the breast cancer and osteoblast cells that were induced upon co-culture. A large increase in osteoblast-derived MMP-13 mRNA and protein was observed. Affymetrix analysis and validation showed induction of MMP-13 was initiated by soluble factors produced by the breast tumor cells, including oncostatin M and the acute response apolipoprotein SAA3. Significant changes in the osteoblast secretomes upon addition of MMP-13 were identified by degradomics from which six novel MMP-13 substrates with the potential to functionally impact breast cancer metastasis to bone were identified and validated. These included inactivation of the chemokines CCL2 and CCL7, activation of platelet-derived growth factor-C, and cleavage of SAA3, osteoprotegerin, CutA, and antithrombin III.

MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression seem to be related to progression of osteoarthritis whereas MMP-8 does not seem to have a specific role with regard to temporomandibular joint disorders. TIMP-1 is considered to be partly related to internal derangement rather than osteoarthritis, but it is not significant.']]"
58,59) Proteolytic roles of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 during progression of chronic periodontitis: initial evidence for MMP-13/MMP-9 activation cascade.,"[['59) [ Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-13 can initiate bone resorption and activate proMMP-9 in vitro, and both these MMPs have been widely implicated in tissue destruction associated with chronic periodontitis. We studied whether MMP-13 activity and TIMP-1 levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) associated with progression of chronic periodontitis assessed clinically and by measuring carboxy-terminal telopeptide of collagen I (ICTP) levels. We additionally addressed whether MMP-13 could potentiate gelatinase activation in diseased gingival tissue. In this prospective study, GCF samples from subjects undergoing clinical progression of chronic periodontitis and healthy controls were screened for ICTP levels, MMP-13 activity and TIMP-1. Diseased gingival explants were cultured, treated or not with MMP-13 with or without adding CL-82198, a synthetic MMP-13 selective inhibitor, and assayed by gelatin zymography and densitometric analysis. Active sites demonstrated increased ICTP levels and MMP-13 activity (p<0.05) in progression subjects. The MMP-9 activation rate was elevated in MMP-13-treated explants (p<0.05) and MMP-13 inhibitor prevented MMP-9 activation. MMP-13 could be implicated in the degradation of soft and hard supporting tissues and proMMP-9 activation during progression of chronic periodontitis. MMP-13 and -9 can potentially form an activation cascade overcoming the protective TIMP-1 shield, which may become useful for diagnostic aims and a target for drug development.']]"
59,60) Phenotypic overlap between MMP-13 and the plasminogen activation system during wound healing in mice.,"[['60) [ Proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix is a crucial step in the healing of incisional skin wounds. Thus, healing of skin wounds is delayed by either plasminogen-deficiency or by treatment with the broad-spectrum metalloproteinase (MP) inhibitor Galardin alone, while the two perturbations combined completely prevent wound healing. Both urokinase-type plasminogen activator and several matrix metallo proteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-3, -9 and -13, are expressed in the leading-edge keratinocytes of skin wounds, which may account for this phenotypic overlap between these classes of proteases. To further test that hypothesis we generated Mmp13;Plau and Mmp13;Plg double-deficient mice in a cross between Mmp13- and Plau-deficient mice as well as Mmp13- and Plg-deficient mice. These mice were examined for normal physiology in a large cohort study and in a well-characterized skin wound healing model, in which we made incisional 20 mm-long full-thickness skin wounds. While mice that are deficient in Mmp13 have a mean healing time indistinguishable to wild-type mice, wound healing in both Plau- and Plg-deficient mice is significantly delayed. Histological analysis of healed wounds revealed a significant increase in keratin 10/14 immunoreactive layers of kerationcytes in the skin surface in Mmp13;Plau double-deficient mice. Furthermore, we observe, by immunohistological analysis, an aberrant angiogenic pattern during wound healing induced by Plau-deficiency, which has not previously been described. We demonstrate a phenotypic overlap, defined as an additional delay in wound healing in the double-deficient mice compared to the individual single-deficient mice, between MMP-13 and the plasminogen activation system in the process of wound healing, but not during gestation and in postnatal development. Thus, a dual targeting of uPA and MMP-13 might be a possible future strategy in designing therapies aimed at tissue repair or other pathological processes, such as cancer invasion, where proteolytic degradation is a hallmark.']]"

TM-induced apoptosis was also closely associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as shown by increased expression of GRP-78 and CHOP proteins. Furthermore, induction of matrix metallo-proteinase (MMP)-13, MMP-9 and ADAM10 expression was highly stimulated by tunicamycin in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TM-induced PARP-1 cleavage was significantly inhibited by treatment with GM6001 (a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor), MMP-9/-13 inhibitor and GI254023X (specific ADAM10 inhibitor). In addition, inhibition of all examined MMPs resulted in reversal of TM-induced apoptosis as well as increased cell viability. When considering the functional implications of MMP-9 and ADAM10, it is likely that active MMP-9 and ADAM10 help regulate the cellular levels of CD44v6 through cleavage of CD44v6 ectodomain during TM-induced apoptosis of Caki-2 cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that multiple TM-induced MMPs may cooperate to induce apoptosis.']""]]"

To evaluate the impact of licofelone on MMP-13 expression/production, promoter, and major MAP kinase signalling pathways and transcription factors. Human osteoarthritis chondrocytes were stimulated by interleukin 1beta (IL1beta) and treated with or without: licofelone (0.3, 1, or 3 mug/ml); NS-398 (10 muM; a specific COX-2 inhibitor); or BayX-1005 (10 muM; a specific 5-LOX inhibitor). MMP-13 synthesis was determined by specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and expression by real time polymerase chain reaction. The effect of licofelone on the MMP-13 promoter was studied through transient transfection; dexamethasone (10(-7) M) was used as comparison. The effect on IL1beta induced MMP-13 signalling pathways was determined using specific ELISA for phosphorylated MAP kinases and transcription factors. Licofelone dose dependently inhibited the IL1beta stimulated production and expression of MMP-13. NS-398 and BayX-1005 had very little effect. Licofelone also inhibited MMP-13 transcription on each of the promoter constructs used. The licofelone inhibition was comparable to that obtained with dexamethasone. Licofelone had no effect on phosphorylated p44/42 or JNK1/2; however, it decreased phosphorylated c-jun and inhibited phosphorylated p38, CREB, and AP-1 activity. Licofelone inhibited MMP-13 production under proinflammatory conditions on human osteoarthritis chondrocytes, through inhibition of the p38/AP-1 pathway and the transcription factor CREB. This may explain some of the mechanisms whereby licofelone exerts its positive effect on osteoarthritic changes.']]"

We studied the spontaneous production of these substances in RA synoviocytes in spheroid culture. Synovial sarcoma cell line SW 982 formed a single spheroid in non-adherent culture plates. It produced interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, PGE(2), MMP-2 and MMP-13.

Adriamycin was administered to MMP-9 or MMP-13 knockout (KO) mice. Glomerular injury was assessed by the quantification of albuminuria, the glomerular injury score and type IV collagen immunostaining. Treatment of mice with Adriamycin (18 mg/kg i.v.) resulted in marked albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis reaching a peak at 4-8 weeks.

However, the regulating action of estrogen on the expression of interstitial collagenases MMP-8 and MMP-13 in osteoblastic cells in vivo remains unclear. We used an ovariectomized osteoporotic rat model to analyze the changes in the histomorphometric parameters of bone after and without treatment with 17beta-estradiol (E(2)); We also used immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to observe changes in the expression of mRNA and the proteins MMP-8, MMP-13 and TIMP-1 in osteoblastic cells in rat proximal tibia.

70,71) IGF-1 regulation of type II collagen and MMP-13 expression in rat endplate chondrocytes via distinct signaling pathways.,"[['71) [ Abnormal maturation and ossification of the endplate chondrocytes play a central role in the pathogenesis of degenerative disorders of the cervical spine. It is widely held that insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) stimulates chondrocyte proliferation and inhibits chondrocyte terminal differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism underlying such regulation is not fully understood. The present study aimed to determine the role of IGF-1 on the mRNA expression of collagen type II, alpha 1 (Col2a1) and matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP-13) in rat endplate chondrocytes. The possible pathways that transduce IGF-1 effects such as phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3)-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) were also investigated in these cells. Cultured endplate chondrocytes harvested from rat cervical spines were treated with IGF-1 (100ng/ml), and the changes in Col2a1 and MMP-13 mRNA were monitored with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MMP-13 activity was also assayed. Activation of signaling proteins was evaluated by western blot analysis. Cells were also treated with pharmacological agents that block PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways. IGF-1 increased Col2a1 mRNA expression in rat endplate chondrocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. IGF-1 treatment resulted in a fourfold increase of Col2a1 mRNA with the effect maximizing at 24h. In contrast, IGF-1 treatment for 24h caused a roughly 50% reduction in MMP-13 mRNA. Similar effects were seen on the protein levels of type II collagen (col2) and MMP-13. Consistent with these results, IGF-1 also repressed MMP-13 activity. IGF-1 activated both the PI3K and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways as evidenced by phosphorylation of either Akt or ERK1/2 (respectively). The PI3K inhibitor Wartmannin significantly inhibited the IGF-1 effect on Col2a1 mRNA expression but did not affect IGF-1-induced repression of MMP-13 expression. In contrast, the ERK/MAPK inhibitor PD98059 significantly inhibited the effect of IGF-1 on MMP-13 mRNA repression and enhanced IGF-1-induced Col2a1 mRNA expression. In rat endplate chondrocytes the PI3K pathway mainly transduces IGF-1 effect on col2 expression while the ERK pathway mediates IGF-1 effect on MMP-13 expression.']]"

Therefore, we examined the effect of Ang II on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), plasminogen activators (PAs), and their inhibitors [i.e., tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and PA inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)] using osteoblastic ROS17/2.8 cells. Treatment with Ang II strikingly increased the expressions of MMP-3 and -13 and promoted cell proliferation associated with reduced alkaline phosphatase activity as well as enhanced phosphorylated expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, p38 MAPK, and stress-activated protein kinases/c-jun N-terminal kinases (SAPK/JNK) in ROS17/2.8 cells. However, Ang II had no effect on the expression of MMP-2, -9, -14, urokinase-type PA, tissue-type PA, TIMP-1, -2, -3, and PAI-1 in cells.

However, the inhibitor is, according to a relative rotation of approximately 20 degrees, oriented differently relative to the proteinase. Upon TIMP binding, the catalytic zinc, the zinc-ligating side chains, the enclosing MMP loop and the S1\' wall-forming segment move significantly and in concert relative to the rest of the cognate MMP, and the active site cleft constricts slightly, probably allowing a more favourable interaction between the Cys1(TIMP) alpha-amino group of the inhibitor and the catalytic zinc ion of the enzyme. Thus, this structure supports the view that the central N-terminal TIMP segment essentially defines the relative positioning of the TIMP, while the flanking edge loops determine the relative orientation, depending on the individual target MMP.""]']]"

Although differentially, both genes are regulated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25D3) and T3, important hormones for bone metabolism. In mouse osteoblasts with a distinct differentiation status, T3 increases the expression of both proteins. By contrast, 1,25D3 stimulates the expression of MMP-13 but inhibits the expression of OCN in these cells. In humans, however, 1,25D3 upregulates both genes while T3 inhibits the OCN expression. Using northern blot hybridization we studied gene expression in the mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1. We show that MMP-13 expression was strongly increased by T3 when the stimulation of OCN was low and, inversely, that the MMP-13 increase was low when T3 strongly stimulated the OCN expression. These findings suggest an interrelationship between OCN and MMP-13 expression. In fact, we observed that externally added OCN attenuated the T3 induced MMP-13 expression dose dependently and, furthermore, increased the 1,25D3 stimulated MMP-13 expression. Using a protein kinase A inhibitor we were able to show that this inhibitor mimics the effect of OCN suggesting a PKA dependent pathway to be involved in this regulatory process. We therefore hypothesize that OCN is a modulator of the hormonally regulated MMP-13 expression.']""]]"

Additionally, under 10 pg/mL TNFalpha, 17beta-estradiol also significantly suppressed the secretion of MMP-1 (in immunoblot by a median of 39.0%, P=0.016; in ELISA by a median of 38.4%, P=0.041). Estrogen did not exert any significant effect on MMP-3, MMP-13, or TIMP-1 expression. With IL-1beta or TNFalpha above 10 pg/mL stimulation, 17beta-estradiol demonstrated no effect on MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, or TIMP-1 secretion. Type II collagenolytic activity in the 50 pg/mL estradiol group decreased by 9.6% (-51.5-5.5%, P>0.05). 17beta-estradiol showed a tendency to decrease in MMP-1 mRNA. Estrogen may improve the imbalance between the amounts of MMPs and TIMP in chondrocytes, and these results suggest that hormone replacement therapy may provide some chondroprotective effect.']""]]"

The expression levels of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 proteins of the lumbar intervertebral disc (L4-L5) tissues were assayed by Western blot and immunoflorescence methods, separately. Compared to the normal and sham groups, MMP-13 expression levels at the time-points of day 28 in the model group, on day 28 (pre-EA) in the EA group were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.01); and TIMP-1 expression levels on day 28 in both model and EA groups were significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Following EA treatment, the expression level of MMP-13 was notably lower in the EA group than in the model group, and that of TIMP-1 was remarkably higher in the EA group than in the model group (P < 0.01).

78,79) BCP crystals increase prostacyclin production and upregulate the prostacyclin receptor in OA synovial fibroblasts: potential effects on mPGES1 and MMP-13.,"[['79) [ To investigate the potential involvement of prostacyclin in basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystal-induced responses in osteoarthritic synovial fibroblasts (OASF). OASF grown in culture were stimulated with BCP crystals. Prostacyclin production was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Expression of prostacyclin synthase (PGIS) and the prostacyclin (IP) receptor was measured. The effects of iloprost, a prostacyclin analogue, on expression of genes implicated in osteoarthritis such as microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase 1 (mPGES1) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were also studied. FPT inhibitor II, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, was used to antagonize iloprost-induced responses. BCP crystal stimulation led to a five-fold increase in prostacyclin production in OASF compared to untreated cells. This induction was attenuated by cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and COX-1 inhibition at 4 and 32h, respectively. PGIS and IP receptor transcripts were constitutively expressed in OASF. BCP crystals upregulated IP receptor expression two-fold. While iloprost diminished BCP crystal-stimulated IP receptor upregulation, the inhibitory effect of iloprost was blocked by the farnesyl transferase inhibitor. In addition, iloprost upregulated mPGES1 and downregulated MMP-13 expression in BCP crystal-stimulated OASF, effects that were not influenced by the farnesyl transferase inhibitor. These data showed for the first time that BCP crystals can increase prostacyclin production and upregulate expression of the IP receptor in OASF. The potential of prostacyclin to influence BCP crystal-stimulated responses was supported by the effects of iloprost on the expression of the IP receptor, mPGES1 and MMP-13. These data demonstrate the potential involvement of prostacyclin in BCP crystal-associated osteoarthritis (OA) and suggest that inhibition of PG synthesis with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have both deleterious and beneficial effects in BCP crystal-associated OA.']]"

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between the expression of collagenase-1 (MMP-1), collagenase-3 (MMP-13) and TIMP-1, as well as the clinicopathological features of LSCCs. The expression of collagenases and TIMP-1 was examined immunohistochemically in 50 cases of surgically obtained specimens of primary LSCCs. Analyses indicated that LSCC cells as well as stromal cells expressed MMP-1, MMP-13 and TIMP-1 immunostaining. Overexpression of TIMP-1 occurred more frequently in non-metastasizing cases (P=0.009). TIMP-1 and MMP-1 staining correlated significantly with the histologic type of LSCC. The keratinizing type of carcinomas exhibited higher TIMP-1 protein expression than the nonkeratinizing variety (P=0.01). TIMP-1 staining was associated with the grade of differentiation, since it was found predominantly in well and moderately differentiated carcinomas (P=0.04). The findings confirm that expression of analyzed MMPs and TIMP-1 is characteristic of LSCC and that these enzymes contribute to the progression of tumors. TIMP-1 upregulation might exhibit lower metastatic potential in LSCCs and is linked rather with an early stage of tumor progression. It seems also that TIMP-1 expression is dependent on the grade of differentiation.']""]]"

As hypoxia is a defining feature of the chondrocyte microenvironment, the present study investigated the possible mechanism through which SDF‑1 induces cartilage degradation under hypoxic conditions. To do this, OA chondrocyte cultures and patient tissue explants pretreated with the CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100 were incubated with SDF‑1. It was identified that hypoxic conditions significantly elevated the expression of CXCR4 in osteoarthritic chondrocytes relative to normoxic conditions. Furthermore, SDF‑1 elevated MMP‑13 mRNA levels and proteinase activity. It also elevated the mRNA and protein levels of runt‑related transcription factor 2, and induced the release of glycosaminoglycans and the inflammatory cytokine, interleukin‑1β. By contrast, such changes did not occur to an appreciable degree in cells that were pretreated with AMD3100. The results of the present study demonstrate that even under hypoxic conditions, where CXCR4 expression is significantly elevated in chondrocytes, AMD3100 effectively blocks this receptor and protects chondrocytes from OA‑induced catabolism, suggesting that the successful inhibition of CXCR4 may be an effective approach for OA treatment.

Here, we report that LHSCCs express high levels of functional CXCR4 receptors, native for chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12). Primary tumor immunohistochemistry from LHSCC patients has revealed significant expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12. Greater expression of CXCR4 but not that of CXCL12 is correlated with LN and distant metastasis. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blots have demonstrated that CXCR4 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were expressed in LHSCC cell lines as well, but failed to detect CXCL12 mRNA expression. CXCL12 treatment enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway activation and the motility/invasiveness of LHSCC cell lines, which were blocked by treatment with a CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100) and a specific MEK inhibitor (U0126). Results show that the mRNA and protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, but not MMP-2 or MMP-9, were elevated in HEp-2 cells in response to CXCL12. Again, U0126 almost inhibited the induction of MMP-13 in HEp-2 cells by stimulating CXCL12. The transcriptional factor, c-Jun, a downstream factor of ERK pathway, was found to be readily phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus after 10 min of exposure to CXCL12. Blockage of c-Jun activity by transfection with c-jun antisense oligodeoxynucleotide significantly decreased CXCL12-induced MMP-13 expression and cell invasion. CXCL12 seems to enhance LHSCC cell invasion through paracrine-activated CXCR4, which triggers ERK/c-Jun-dependent MMP-13 upregulation.']""]]"

MMP-13 and TIMP-1 determinations were carried out by immunodot blots and immunowestern blots. In progressive periodontitis, MMP-13 and TIMP-1 remained unchanged between active and inactive sites, but as the TIMP-1 relative levels increased together with MMP-13 elevation in inactive samples, an inverse correlation was observed in active sites. Besides, MMP-13 was undetectable in healthy controls. Chronic periodontitis is characterized by increased MMP-13 expression. During disease progression, active sites tended to decrease TIMP-1 levels in association with MMP-13 elevation.']]"
83,84) Estrogen effects on MMP-13 and MMP-14 regulation of left ventricular mass in Dahl salt-induced hypertension.,"[['84) [ Female Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats fed a low-salt diet develop hypertension at 6 months of age. Ovariectomy at 2 months of age accelerates the development of hypertension, and estrogen replacement delays it. Although acute pressure overload induces structural changes in the left ventricle (LV) further effects of gradual hypertension on LV remodeling have not been examined in the DS rat model. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that aging and estrogen loss in hypertensive DS rats are accompanied by changes in LV remodeling. Four groups of DS rats were examined: young intact, middle-aged (MA) intact, MA ovariectomized (MA-OVX), and MA-OVX with 17beta-eestradiol (E(2)) supplementation (MA-OVX+E(2)). Myocardial matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs),and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins were assessed by immunoblotting. Each of the 4 groups comprised 6 animals. Mean (SEM) LV mass was significantly greater in the MA-intact and the MA-OVX groups (1257 [31] mg and 1199 [25] mg, respectively; both, P < 0.05) compared with the young-intact group (697 [6] mg). LV mass in the MA-OVX+E(2) group was significantly lower compared with the MA-intact and MA-OVX groups (both, P < 0.05), suggesting that estrogen may attenuate LV remodeling. Fibronectin and collagen III and IV concentrations increased significantly in the MA-intact and MA-OOVX groups (all, P < 0.05),indicating increased fibrosis. Multiple MMPs also increased in the MA-intact an nd MA-OVX rats, including MMP-3, -7, -99, -113, and -114, and all TIMPs. In contrast, estrogen attenuated fibrosis by increasing MMP-8 concentrations and increasing collagen III fragments. From good-fit regression modeling, MMP-13 and MMP-14 concentrations correlated positively with LV mass for the MA-intact and MA-OVX groups, respectively. Gradual hypertension stimulated ECM turnover by increasing both MMP/TIMP production and ECM degradation. Estrogen loss or gain resulted in a shift in MMP profiles, suggesting that MMP-13 and MMP-14 may be differentially regulated in postmenopausal hypertension.']]"

Although low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly decreased in the 14 patients (mean baseline level, 152 ± 21 mg/dL vs mean post-therapy level, 73 ± 45 mg/dL; P < 0.001), matrix metalloproteinase-13 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 levels were unchanged (matrix metalloproteinase-13, 0.295 ± 0.06 ng/mL vs 0.323 ± 0.11 ng/mL, P = 0.12; and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, 400.8 ± 43.4 ng/mL vs 395.3 ± 47.5 ng/mL, P = 0.26).

To investigate the effects of topical treatment with a CTSG inhibitor, β-keto-phosphonic acid (KPA), on basement membrane damage in chronically UV-irradiated hairless mouse skin. The dorsal skin of hairless mice was exposed to UV three times per week for 8\\xa0weeks. KPA was applied immediately after each session of UV irradiation. The basement membrane components, CTSG expression, and neutrophil infiltration were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. The basement membrane structures were visualized by transmission electron microscope. CTSG and MMP-13 protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting. Assessment of wrinkle formation was examined using a skin replica assay. β-keto-phosphonic acid prevented UV irradiation-induced decrease in type VII collagen, laminin 332, and perlecan at the basement membrane zone and prevented UV-induced breakage of lamina densa and UV-induced shortening of hemidesmosome. KPA prevented UV-induced CTSG and MMP-13 expressions in chronically UV-irradiated hairless mice. Increase in neutrophil infiltration by UV irradiation and UV-induced wrinkle formation was also prevented by KPA.

We have previously demonstrated that HDACis (valproic acid, trichostatin A) increase mineralization in dental papillae-derived cell-lines and primary DPCs by stimulation of dentinogenic gene expression. Here, we investigated novel genes regulated by the HDACi, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), to identify new pathways contributing to DPC differentiation. SAHA significantly compromised DPC viability only at relatively high concentrations (5\\u2009μM); while low concentrations (1\\u2009μM) SAHA did not increase apoptosis. HDACi-exposure for 24\\u2009h induced mineralization-per-cell dose-dependently after 2 weeks; however, constant 14d SAHA-exposure inhibited mineralization. Microarray analysis (24\\u2009h and 14\\u2009days) of SAHA exposed cultures highlighted that 764 transcripts showed a significant >2.0-fold change at 24\\u2009h, which reduced to 36 genes at 14\\u2009days. 59% of genes were down-regulated at 24\\u2009h and 36% at 14\\u2009days, respectively. Pathway analysis indicated SAHA increased expression of members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. Furthermore, SAHA-supplementation increased MMP-13 protein expression (7\\u2009d, 14\\u2009days) and enzyme activity (48\\u2009h, 14\\u2009days). Selective MMP-13-inhibition (MMP-13i) dose-dependently accelerated mineralization in both SAHA-treated and non-treated cultures. MMP-13i-supplementation promoted expression of several mineralization-associated markers, however, HDACi-induced cell migration and wound healing were impaired. Data demonstrate that short-term low-dose SAHA-exposure promotes mineralization in DPCs by modulating gene pathways and tissue proteases. MMP-13i further increased mineralization-associated events, but decreased HDACi cell migration indicating a specific role for MMP-13 in pulpal repair processes. Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC and MMP may provide novel insights into pulpal repair processes with significant translational benefit. J. Cell.

Human OA chondrocytes were either left untreated or treated with various concentrations of vorinostat followed by incubation with IL-1β (5ng/mL). Effects of vorinostat on IL-1β-induced gene and protein expression of iNOS, MMP-1, MMP-13 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) were verified by quantitative real time-PCR and Western blot analysis. Production of NO, MMP-1, MMP-13 and TIMP-1 released in culture supernatant was estimated using commercially available kits. The roles of NF-κB and MAPK pathways in the regulation of targeted genes and the mechanism involved in vorinostat mediated modulation of these genes were determined by Western blot using specific antibodies. We found that vorinostat down-regulated iNOS, MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression and up-regulated TIMP-1 expression in human OA chondrocytes. In addition, the release of NO, MMP-1 and MMP-13 secreted from IL-1β stimulated chondrocytes was also suppressed by vorinostat. Interestingly, vorinostat selectively inhibited IL-1β-induced p38 and ERK1/2 activation without affecting JNK activation. Furthermore, we observed that vorinostat inhibited NF-κB pathway by suppressing the degradation of I-κBα and attenuating NF-κB p65 translocation to the nucleus. These results suggest that vorinostat may be a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of OA. ']""]]"

Human MMP-13 is expressed by fibroblasts in chronic cutaneous ulcers, but not in normally healing adult skin wounds. However, MMP-13 is produced by fibroblasts in adult gingival and in fetal skin wounds characterized by rapid collagen remodeling and scarless healing. Here, we have examined the role of human MMP-13 in remodeling of three-dimensional (3D) collagenous matrix by primary adult human skin fibroblasts. The high level of human MMP-13 expression by fibroblasts achieved by adenoviral gene delivery resulted in potent enhancement of remodeling and contraction of 3D collagen. Fibroblasts expressing MMP-13 in 3D collagen possessed altered filamentous actin morphology with patch-like actin distribution in cell extensions. The expression of MMP-13 promotes survival and proliferation of fibroblasts in floating collagen gel, and results in activation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 by these cells. The results provide evidence for a novel role for human MMP-13 in regulating dermal fibroblast survival, proliferation, and interaction in 3D collagen, which may be an important survival mechanism for fibroblasts in chronic skin ulcers and contribute to scarless healing of adult gingival and fetal skin wounds.']""]]"

Samples from 31 keratoacanthomas and 15 grade I SCCs were studied using immunohistochemistry for MMP-2, -7, -8, -9, -10, -13, and -19 and p16 and laminin-5gamma2 chain. In situ hybridization for MMP-7, -10, and -13 was performed in a subset of tumors. Keratinocytes with atypia, presence of neovascularization, and composition of the inflammatory infiltrate were graded from hematoxylin-eosin stainings. MMP-7 was present in the epithelium of 4/31 keratoacanthomas and 9/15 SCCs, MMP-8 in 3/30 keratoacanthomas and 0/15 SCCs, but MMP-13 in 16/31 keratoacanthomas and 10/15 SCCs, and MMP-10 in 28/31 keratoacanthomas and all cancers.

MMP-19 was upregulated in proliferating epithelium of keratoacanthomas as was p16. Cytoplasmic laminin-5gamma2 was particularly abundant in keratinocytes at the pushing border of MMP-13-positive keratoacanthomas. We conclude that although some MMPs (MMP-10 and -13) are abundantly expressed in keratoacanthomas, the presence of MMP-7 and -9 in their epithelial pushing border is rare and should raise suspicion of SCC. Further, the loss of MMP-19 and p16 could aid in making the differential diagnosis between well-differentiated SCC and keratoacanthoma. Frequent expression of the transformation-specific MMP-13 in keratoacanthomas suggests that they are not benign tumors but incomplete SCCs.']""]]"

The effects of MAP kinase inhibitors on cytokine-induced expression of MMP-1 and -13 were evaluated using ELISA and Western blot analyses. The possible involvement of the Runx2 pathway in mediating p38 effects on MMP-13 expression was analyzed using promoter-reporter assays, ELISA and immunoprecipitation analyses. IL-1beta and TNFalpha strongly induced the expression of MMP-1 and -13 in SW1353 cells and HACs, whereas only TNFalpha was found to induce the expression of these two MMPs in JJ012 cells. Cytokine treatment did not result in a significant increase in the activity of MMPs because of the excess production of endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs). Treatment with p38 kinase inhibitors (SB203580 and SB242235) strongly inhibited cytokine-induced MMP-13 expression in a dose-dependent fashion while having a somewhat weaker inhibitory effect on MMP-1 expression. In contrast, inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways did not inhibit the expression of either MMP. Overexpression of Runx2 robustly stimulated the transcriptional activation of MMP-13 but had no effect on MMP-1 expression. Furthermore, IL-1beta induced the phosphorylation of Runx2, and this effect was blocked by a p38 kinase inhibitor. Our data suggest that Runx2 is likely to be a key downstream mediator of p38 effects in the differential regulation of IL-1beta induced MMP-13 expression. These studies demonstrate the differential inhibition of cytokine-induced MMP-1 and -13 expression by p38 kinase inhibitors in human chondrosarcoma cells. Our studies also suggest the involvement of Runx2, at least in part, in mediating the effects of p38 on MMP-13 expression.']]"

We also evaluated cultured bovine knee chondrocytes and immortalized human articular chondrocytes (CH-8 cells), employing the CaR calcimimetic agonist NPS R-467 or altering physiologic extracellular calcium (1.8 mM). Immunohistochemistry revealed that CaR expression became up-regulated in the superficial zone at 4 months of age in the guinea pig medial tibial plateau cartilage as early OA developed. CaR expression later became up-regulated in the middle zone. PTHrP content, measured by immunoassay, was significantly increased in the medial tibial plateau cartilage as OA developed and progressed.

Extracellular calcium-sensing appeared essential for PTHrP and interleukin (IL)-1 to induce MMP-13 and for PTHrP 1-34 to suppress TIMP-3 expression. Chondrocyte CaR expression becomes up-regulated early in the course of spontaneous guinea pig knee OA. Chondrocyte CaR-mediated extracellular calcium-sensing promotes PTHrP expression, modulates the effects of PTHrP and IL-1, and promotes MMP-13 expression and TIMP-3 depletion.

Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of SK-216 into mouse models resulted in downregulation of PAI-1 expression levels in the primary tumors and showed suppression of lung metastases without influencing the proliferative activity of the tumor cells in the primary lesions. These results indicate that SK-216, a PAI-1 inhibitor, may serve as a novel drug to prevent lung metastasis in human osteosarcoma.']""]]"

Different concentrations of CT (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 50\\xa0nM) were used for treating IL-1β stimulated chondrocytes. Cell viability of chondrocytes was measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) method.

CT inhibited MMP-13 expression and promoted TIMP-1 expression in the IL-1β stimulated human chondrocytes. The CT-mediated alteration of MMP-13/TIMP-1 ratio was partially attributed to the inactivation of the p50- nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway by suppressing p50 in IL-1β stimulated chondrocytes.

114,115) Site-specific tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 governs the matrix metalloproteinases-dependent degradation of crosslinked collagen scaffolds and is correlated with interleukin-10.,"[[""115) ['We have previously shown that the foreign body reaction (FBR) against crosslinked collagen type I (Col-I) differs between subcutaneous and epicardial implantation sites; Col-I was quickly degraded epicardially, whereas degradation was attenuated subcutaneously. The current study set out to dissect the nature and regulation of the MMP-based degradation of implanted Col-I in mice during the FBR. Immunohistochemistry showed that MMP-2, MMP-8 and MMP-13 were present in subcutaneous and epicardial implants, whereas only MMP-9 was also present epicardially. Western blotting showed that MMP-8 and MMP-9 were mainly present in their inactive proform. In contrast, collagenase MMP-13 and gelatinase MMP-2 were the predominant active MMPs at both sites. Interestingly, the major MMP inhibitor TIMP-1 was solely observed in subcutaneous implants, which is why MMP-13 and MMP-2 are not able to degrade the collagen scaffold at the subcutaneous implantation site. Interleukin 10 (IL-10), a potent inducer of TIMP-1 expression, was also mainly detected subcutaneously; giant cells were the main source. Therefore, we surmise that IL-10, through regulation of the balance between MMPs and TIMP-1, suppresses the FBR against implanted biomaterials. Together, our findings would provide cues and clues to improve future therapies in regenerative medicine that are based on the tuned regulation of the degradation of biomaterial scaffolds.']""]]"

116,117) Effects of Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitor on Stress-Shielded Tendons.,"[[""117) ['Mechanical stress plays an important role in preserving the integrity of bone and ligament. Stress shielding reduces mechanical load on bone or tendons, resulting in tissue degradation. Previous studies showed that deterioration of the tendon structure during stress shielding is associated with elevated expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. This study examined the therapeutic potential of the TNF inhibitor etanercept in preventing morphologic deterioration of the Achilles tendon after stress shielding. Rats (N=48) were exposed to stress shielding of the left Achilles tendon and treated with etanercept or phosphate-buffered saline for 2 or 4 weeks. The right Achilles tendons were used as controls. After 2 or 4 weeks, stress-shielded tendons appeared less smooth than control tendons, and the stress-shielded tendons formed adhesions with surrounding tissues. Transmission electron microscopy also showed disarray of the collagen fibrils and a significant increase in the number of small-diameter collagen fibrils. These changes were associated with increased expression of TNF-α, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, MMP-3, collagen I, and collagen III. Treatment with 2 weeks of etanercept injection reduced morphologic changes in collagen organization and structure induced by stress shielding. Etanercept treatment also attenuated upregulation of MMP-13, MMP-3, and collagen III levels. However, no significant difference was observed between the etanercept group and the phosphate-buffered saline group after 4 weeks of treatment. The current findings show that TNF-α inhibition can protect against the early stages of tendon tissue remodeling induced by stress shielding, but additional interventions may be necessary to prevent tendon degeneration with long-term stress shielding.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the role of NOX4 in Dex-induced ROS over-production. Healthy chondrocytes were harvested from the cartilage debris from 6 female patients. NOX4 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression levels in these cells were evaluated in the presence of Dex. Changes in the number of apoptotic and viable Dex-treated chondrocytes were recorded after the cells were treated with NOX and p38 MAPK inhibitors. Changes in matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) expression levels in Dex-treated chondrocytes were also investigated. The Dex treatment increased NOX4 expression via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Treatment of cells with apocynin, a NOX inhibitor, decreased intracellular ROS levels and inhibited p38 MAPK activation. Treatment of cells with a ROS scavenger also reduced p38 MAPK expression. Treatment of cells with a NOX inhibitor, ROS scavenger and p38 MAPK inhibitor rescued chondrocytes from Dex-induced apoptosis. Moreover, treatment of cells with these agents blocked MMP-13 expression in Dex-treated chondrocytes. NOX4 silencing also suppressed p38 MAPK and MMP-13 expression. Dex triggered apoptosis and MMP-13 expression through the NOX4/ROS/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. NOX4 may be a therapeutic target in the management of Dex-induced complications.']""]]"

Very little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of these tumours, which are often undiagnosed for a long time. As matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated at all stages of tumorigenesis, we investigated whether the pattern of epithelial MMP expression can predict development of SCC from pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of chronic wounds. Samples from nine patients with SCCs that had arisen in chronic wounds and 31 with venous leg ulcers were studied using immunohistochemistry for MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-13, MMP-19 and the tumour suppressor p16. In situ hybridization was performed for MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-12 and MMP-13. MMP-7 was expressed by malignantly transformed epithelium, while it was absent from chronic wounds. MMP-9 was detected in the epithelium in both SCCs and chronic wounds. Epithelial MMP-13 expression was strong in SCC, but was absent in chronic wounds. MMP-12 was expressed in the epithelium in two SCCs, while macrophages were positive in chronic wounds. MMP-19 was induced in proliferating epithelium of wounds, but was absent from invasive areas of SCC. p16 was expressed by keratinocytes in half of the chronic wounds and at superficial margins of SCCs, while invasive areas were negative. Our results suggest that epithelial expression of MMP-7, MMP-12 and MMP-13, but not that of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9 and MMP-10, in chronic wounds provides a diagnostic clue for distinguishing SCCs from nonmalignant wounds. The loss of MMP-19 and p16 from the epithelium could aid in making the differential diagnosis between well-differentiated SCCs and nonmalignant chronic wounds.']]"

G141 was screened and identified via cell-free kinase-inhibition assay.

In the ex vivo study, proteoglycan loss was markedly reduced in G141 treated human cartilage explants. For the in vivo study, intra-articular injection of G141 attenuated the surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) induced cartilage destruction and chondrocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis in mice. Our data suggest that pharmacologically antagonize FGFR1 using G141 protects articular cartilage from osteoarthritic changes, and intra-articular injection of G141 is potentially an effective therapy to alleviate OA progression.

Wistar rats were randomly allocated into a normal group, and a model group. To induce liver fibrosis, rats were intraperitoneally injected with dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) three consecutive times in the first week, then two consecutive times per week, totally for 6 weeks. In the normal control group, rats were treated with saline by the same means. Animals were sacrificed 1, 4, 10, 17, 28, 42, 56 days after starting DMN injections. Conventional histological examinations were performed after hematoxylin and eosin, and Masson stain. Fibrosis stages were classified into 0 to 4. Hydroxyproline contents were determined after liver tissues were hydrolyzed in HCl at 160 degrees C for 2 h and then measured with spectrometry at 560 nm wavelength. mRNA levels of MMP-13, TIMP-1, type I and III collagen were determined by semi-quantitive RT-PCR. In the model group, hepatic type I pro-collagen mRNA expression started to increase on the 10th day after DMN administration (t = 2.85, P < 0.05), type III started to increase on the 28th day (t = 4.16, P< 0.01), and TIMP-1 mRNA expression started to increase on the 4th day (t = 2.60, P < 0.05). They all remained much higher than in the normal group throughout the remaining study period. Hepatic MMP-13 mRNA expression started to increase on the 17th day after DMN administration and remained at a higher level than in the normal group until he 28th day (t = 4.08, P < 0.01), then gradually returned to normal level at the end of the study period. Although hepatic MMP-13 expression transiently increased during liver fibrosis, enhanced expression of TIMP-1 from the early periods of liver fibrosis inhibited the collagen degrading ability of MMP-13, therefore, over-expressed collagen accumulated in the liver. Thus, it is hypothesized that TIMPs play a pivotal role in liver fibrosis.']]"

As adaptor molecules, both proteins bridge and stabilize macromolecular networks consisting of fibrillar collagens and proteoglycans. Mutations in the genes coding for COMP and matrilin 3 have been linked to human chondrodysplasias, while in mice, deficiency in COMP or matrilin 3 does not cause any pronounced skeletal abnormalities. Given the similar functions of COMP and matrilin 3 in the assembly and stabilization of the extracellular matrix, our aim was to determine whether these proteins could functionally compensate for each other. To assess this putative redundancy of COMP and matrilin 3, we generated COMP/matrilin 3 double-deficient mice and performed an in-depth analysis of their skeletal development. At the newborn stage, the overall skeletal morphology of the double mutants was normal, but at 1 month of age, the long bones were shortened and the total body length reduced. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography revealed increased metaphyseal trabecular bone mineral density in the femora. Moreover, the degradation of aggrecan in the cartilage remnants in the metaphyseal trabecular bone was delayed, paralleled by increased deposition of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP-3). The structure and morphology of the growth plate were grossly normal, but in the center, focal closures were observed, a phenotype very similar to that described in matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13)-deficient mice. We propose that a lack of COMP and matrilin 3 leads to increased deposition of TIMP-3, which causes partial inactivation of MMPs, including MMP-13, a mechanism that would explain the similarities in phenotype between COMP/matrilin 3 double-deficient and MMP-13-deficient mice.']]"

For MMP-2 and MMP-9, greater differences were observed in enzyme activity than in plasma concentrations. TIMP-1 was reduced in PCa patients with metastasis, even if the intergroup differences were not statistically significant.

A fourth group consisted of untreated dogs that were used as normal controls. Specimens of cartilage were selected from lesional areas of OA femoral condyles and tibial plateaus, and were processed for real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical analyses.

Licofelone treatment decreased the levels of both mRNA expression and protein synthesis of the factors studied. Of note was the marked reduction in the level of 5-LOX gene expression. The effects of the drug were about the same at both tested dosages. In vivo treatment with therapeutic dosages of licofelone has been found to reduce the degradation of OA cartilage in experimental OA.

In this study, the molecular mechanism responsible for TGF-β1-stimulation of MMP-13 expression via Runx2 in osteoblastic cells was elucidated. TGF-β1 stimulated the phosphorylation of Runx2 at serine amino acids, and ERK inhibition blocked this effect in rat (UMR106-01) and human (MG-63) osteoblastic cells. Pretreatment with okadaic acid, a serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor, increased Runx2 serine phosphorylation in osteoblastic cells. When cells were pretreated with an ERK inhibitor, TGF-β1-mediated stimulation of MMP-13 mRNA expression decreased. Nano-ESI/LC/MS analysis identified that TGF-β1 stimulates Runx2 phosphorylation at three serine amino acids. Transient transfection of mouse mesenchymal stem cells (C3H10T1/2) with Runx2 serine mutant constructs decreased TGF-β1-mediated Runx2 serine phosphorylation. A luciferase reporter assay identified that TGF-β1 stimulated MMP-13 promoter activity in these cells only in the presence of the wild Runx2 construct, and not with mutant Runx2. Thus, TGF-β1 stimulates the phosphorylation of Runx2 at three serine amino acids, and this event is required for MMP-13 expression in osteoblastic cells. Hence, this study contributes to the knowledge of events governing bone remodeling and bone-related diseases.']""]]"

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms and roles of MMP-13 secretion in human small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) and functional polymorphisms of the MMP13 gene. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and interferon β (IFN-β) stimulated the secretion of MMP-13 from SAECs by more than several hundred-fold. Stimulation of the secretion by poly(I:C) was abolished by SB304680 (p38 inhibitor), LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor I, RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) inhibitor, and Bay 11-7082 (NF-κB inhibitor), while stimulation by IFN-β was inhibited by all except Bay 11-7082. These data suggested that the secretion of MMP-13 was mediated through IFN receptor pathways independently of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and that poly(I:C) stimulated IFN secretion in an NF-κB-dependent manner from SAECs, leading to IFN-stimulated MMP-13 secretion. Chemical MMP-13 inhibitors and MMP-13 small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited IFN-stimulated secretion of interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), suggesting that MMP-13 is involved in the secretion of these virus-induced proinflammatory chemokines.

Serum hyaluronic acid, laminin, procollagen type III, and collagen type IV were examined by using a radioimmunoassay. Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) protein in the liver, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) protein in cytoplasm by using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, and MMP-13, TIMP-1, and TGF-β1 mRNA levels in the liver were studied using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Liver histopathology was significantly better in rats given thalidomide than in the untreated model group. The levels of TIMP-1 and TGF-β1 mRNA and protein expressions were decreased significantly and MMP-13 mRNA and protein in the liver were significantly elevated in the thalidomide-treated group. Thalidomide may exert its effects on the regulation of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 via inhibition of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, which enhances the degradation of extracellular matrix and accelerates the regression of hepatic cirrhosis in rats.']]"
132,133) Elevated expression of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas may reflect increased tumor invasiveness.,"[['133) [ Matrix metalloproteinases [MMPs], which degrade the extracellular matrix, play an important role in the invasion and metastasis of squamous cell carcinomas. One MMP, MMP-13, is thought to play a central role in MMP activation. The purpose of this study was to investigate MMP-13 and TIMP-1 expression in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and to relate these levels of expression to histologic patterns of invasion. This study included T1 lesions obtained via biopsy from the larynx, tongue, and skin/mucosa of 78 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. The relationship between expression of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 and the mode of tumor invasion [MI] was evaluated immunohistochemically, using breast carcinoma tissue as a positive control. Increased expression was observed in highly invasive tumors, as reflected by the significant correlation between the degree of staining for MMP-13 or TIMP-1 and MI grade [p < 0.05]. There was no significant relationship between the degree of staining for MMP-13 or TIMP-1 and patient age, sex, tumor site, or tumor histologic grade. In addition, levels of staining for MMP-13 did not correlate with levels of staining for TIMP-1. The expression of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 appears to play an important role in determining the invasive capacity of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Whereas additional studies are needed to confirm these findings, evaluating expression of these MMPs in small biopsy samples may be useful in determining the invasive capacity of these tumors at an earlier stage.']]"

Phosphorylations of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) in IL-6+sIL-6R-treated chondrocytes were detected by western blotting. IL-6+sIL-6R induced MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13 productions from human chondrocyte. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway resulted in marked decreases of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13 induction by IL-6. In contrast, STAT inhibition only slightly attenuated the production of MMPs. HA inhibited MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13 induction by IL-6, which was reversed by the addition of anti-CD44 antibody but not anti-ICAM-1 antibody. Pre-treatment of cells with HA reduced the phosphorylation of ERK, but not MEK. Expression levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in HA-treated chondrocytes were assessed by western blotting. HA induced the expression of MKP-1, a negative regulator of ERK1/2 in IL-6+sIL-6R-treated or untreated chondrocytes, and the MKP-1 inhibitor and MKP-1 siRNA reversed the HA-induced suppression of MMP induction by IL-6.

In vitro direct effect of TSA was examined by real-time PCR for mRNA of type II collagen, aggrecan, MMP-3, and MMP-13 in murine chondrogenic ATDC5 cells after pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation. In the TSA-treated group, clinical arthritis was significantly ameliorated in a dose-dependent manner. The severity of synovial inflammation and the cartilage destruction score were significantly lower in the TSA 2.0 mg/kg group compared to the other TSA-treated groups. On immunohistochemistry, the number of MMP-3 and MMP-13-positive chondrocytes was significantly lower in the TSA 2.0 mg/kg group than in the control group. In contrast, the number of TIMP-1-positive cells and acetyl-histone H4-positive cells was significantly higher in the TSA 2.0mg/kg group than in the control group.

135,136) Downregulation of microRNA-448 inhibits IL-1β-induced cartilage degradation in human chondrocytes via upregulation of matrilin-3.,"[['136) [ Osteoarthritis is characterized by the continuous degradation of the articular cartilage. The microRNA miR-448 has been found to be broadly involved in cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and EMT. While aberrant expression of miR-448 has been found in multiple cancers, its level in osteoarthritis cartilage and its role in the progression of this disease are still unknown. Here, we examined the functional roles of miR-448 and its expression in osteoarthritis tissues, including IL-1β-stimulated osteoarthritis chondrocytes. Chondrocytes were isolated from human articular cartilage and stimulated with IL-1β. The expression levels of miR-448 in the cartilage and chondrocytes were both determined. After transfection with an miR-448 mimic or inhibitor, the mRNA levels of aggrecan, type II collagen and MMP-13 were determined. Luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to explore whether matrilin-3 was a target of miR-448. Furthermore, we co-transfected chondrocytes with miR-448 inhibitor and siRNA for matrilin-3 and then stimulated them with IL-1β to determine whether miR-448-mediated IL-1β-induced cartilage matrix degradation resulted from directly targeting matrilin-3. The level of miR-448 was significantly higher and matrilin-3 expression was significantly lower in osteoarthritis cartilage and IL-1β-induced chondrocytes than in normal tissues and cells. Furthermore, matrilin-3 expression was reduced by miR-448 overexpression. MiR-448 downregulation significantly alleviated the IL-1β-induced downregulation of aggrecan and type II collagen expression, and upregulation of MMP-13 expression. MiR-448 overexpression had the opposite effects. Knockdown of matrilin-3 reversed the effects of the miR-448 inhibitor on the expressions of aggrecan, type II collagen and MMP-13. The findings showed that miR-448 contributed to the progression of osteoarthritis by directly targeting matrilin-3. This indicates that it has potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of osteoarthritis.']]"

One of the major factors involves in remodeling process is matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-13 that has been shown to degrade the native interstitial collagens in several tissues. To study how mechanical strain affects extracellular matrix degradation by MMP-13, a biaxial strain was applied to MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells plated onto a collagen-coated flexible elastic membrane. The MMP-13 protein and mRNA expression were determined by Western blotting and reverse transcriptase-PCR, respectively. The zymographic activities of MMP-13 increased dramatically at 30 min, reached a peak by 2-fold at 1 h, and maintained up to 4 h. Moreover, the MMP-13 and c-fos mRNA expressed at 5 min, increased to 2.8- and 3-fold at 1 h, respectively, and gradually declined thereafter. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D did not inhibit the MMP-13 and c-fos mRNA expression, suggesting that such expression does not require de novo protein synthesis and not change their stabilities. To investigate which of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways involves in the expression of MMP-13, inhibitors such as PD98059, SB203580, and SP600125 were used. However, only PD98059 (an inhibitor of MEK1/2 activation) inhibited MMP-13 and c-fos gene expression; the result was further substantiated by transfecting with the dominant negative mutants of MEK1/2 (MEK K97R) and ERK2. Taken together, our results showed that mechanical strain induces the MMP-13 expression through MEK-ERK signaling pathway to regulate mechanical adaptation.']""]]"

Use of a pharmacological inhibitor (U0126) demonstrated that extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) plays a major role in TPA-induced MMP-13 gene expression. The 5\'-flanking sequences of the MMP-13 gene contain binding sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1) and Runx. Both transcription factor families can be modulated by ERK and have been implicated in MMP-13 gene expression. TPA stimulated ERK-dependent increases in c-Fos protein and the c-Fos content of AP-1 complexes. MMP-13 promoter studies indicated that TPA requires AP-1, but not Runx, to induce MMP-13 gene expression. These studies show that in mouse keratinocytes MMP-13 gene expression can be induced through a Runx-independent pathway that involves the ERK-dependent modulation of AP-1.""]']]"

This study aims to explore the role of montelukast in regulating MMP-13 expression induced by LPS in osteoblasts. Our results indicate that LPS stimulated cysLT1R expression in mouse MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Notably, LPS-induced up-regulation of MMP-13 was ameliorated by treatment with montelukast in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment with montelukast stimulated the expression of SOCS3, an inhibitor of MMP-13. Silencing of SOCS3 abolished the inhibitory effects of montelukast on MMP-13 expression. Mechanistically, we found that montelukast suppressed LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 as well as NF-κB transcriptional activity by inhibiting the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. These data suggest that montelukast can modulate inflammatory events in bone diseases.']""]]"

SCC cells express several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and they often harbor mutations in p53 tumor suppressor gene. Collagenase-3 (MMP-13) is specifically expressed by tumor cells of SCCs and it apparently plays an important role in their invasion and metastasis. We used adenoviral gene delivery to examine the effect of wild-type p53 on MMP-13 expression in four head and neck SCC cell lines with mutated p53. Adenoviral delivery of p53 resulted in potent inhibition in production of proMMP-13 (by 71 to 92%) and collagenase-1 (MMP-1) (by 27 to 93%) by all cell lines in 24 h, whereas production of gelatinase-A (MMP-2) and gelatinase-B (MMP-9) was not altered. Adenoviral expression of p53 also suppressed invasion of SCC cells through Matrigel by 35%. Expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1) was induced 24 h after p53 gene delivery in all SCC cell lines, except one, which lacked detectable p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression. Number of viable cells was not altered and no apoptotic cells were seen 24 h after p53 delivery. These results show, that wild-type p53 potently inhibits expression of MMP-13 and MMP-1 by SCC cells independently of its pro-apoptotic effect. Together these results indicate, that p53 exerts a bi-phasic tumor suppressor effect on SCC cells: inhibition of cell invasion followed by induction of programmed cell death.']""]]"

Experimental group 1 underwent sectioning of the ACL of the right knee with no active treatment (placebo group). Experimental groups 2 and 3 underwent sectioning of the ACL of the right knee and were administered therapeutic concentrations of licofelone (2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg/day p.o., respectively) for 8 weeks, beginning the day following surgery. Group 4 consisted of untreated dogs used as normal control. Specimens of subchondral bone including the calcified cartilage were selected from lesional and non-lesional areas of OA tibial plateaus. Specimens were processed for static morphometric analysis and immunohistochemical analysis for MMP-13 and cathepsin K. As indicated by a reduction in bone surface and trabecular thickness, a significant loss of subchondral bone occurred in OA dogs. These changes were associated with an increased level of MMP-13 synthesis by bone cells and an increase in the osteoclast population that stained strongly positive for cathepsin K and MMP-13. Changes were much more pronounced in the specimens taken from the lesional areas. Treatment with licofelone decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, the OA bone morphological changes at the same time it reduced the level of MMP-13 in bone cells and the number of cathepsin K and MMP-13 positive osteoclasts. Increased bone loss and bone resorption is associated with the development of OA cartilage lesions. Licofelone treatment was found to prevent the morphological and biochemical changes seen in early experimental OA effectively. These findings may help explain the mechanisms by which this drug could exert its possible effect on the development of OA.']]"
142,143) High-resolution solution structure of the catalytic fragment of human collagenase-3 (MMP-13) complexed with a hydroxamic acid inhibitor.,"[['143) [""The high-resolution solution structure of the catalytic fragment of human collagenase-3 (MMP-13) complexed with a sulfonamide derivative of a hydroxamic acid compound (WAY-151693) has been determined by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR.

The atomic rms distribution about the mean coordinate positions for the 30 structures is 0.43(+/-0.05) A for the backbone atoms, 0.80(+/-0.09) A for all atoms, and 0.47(+/-0.04) A for all atoms excluding disordered side-chains. The overall structure of MMP-13 is composed of a beta-sheet consisting of five beta-strands in a mixed parallel and anti-parallel arrangement and three alpha-helices where its overall fold is consistent with previously solved MMP structures. A comparison of the NMR structure of MMP-13 with the published 1.6 A resolution X-ray structure indicates that the major differences between the structures is associated with loop dynamics and crystal-packing interactions. The side-chains of some active-site residues for the NMR and X-ray structures of MMP-13 adopt distinct conformations. This is attributed to the presence of unique inhibitors in the two structures that encounter distinct interactions with MMP-13. The major structural difference observed between the MMP-13 and MMP-1 NMR structures is the relative size and shape of the S1\' pocket where this pocket is significantly longer for MMP-13, nearly reaching the surface of the protein. Additionally, MMP-1 and MMP-13 exhibit different dynamic properties for the active-site loop and the structural Zn-binding region. The inhibitor WAY-151693 is well defined in the MMP-13 active-site based on a total of 52 distance restraints.

The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of M8I were analyzed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the reporter gene assay, Western blot, and RT-PCR analysis. Treatment with LTA, a major cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, led to astrocyte activation and induced the expression of inflammatory molecules such as iNOS, COX-2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, LTA induced the expression of MMPs such as MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9, and MMP-13 in rat primary astrocytes.

However, it has been proposed that p21 is a regulator of transcription factor activity. In this study, we evaluated the role of p21 in response to biomechanical stress. Human chondrocytes were treated with p21-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), and cyclic tensile strain was introduced in the presence or absence of a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-specific inhibitor. Further, we developed an in vivo OA model in a p21-knockout background for in vivo experiments. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP13) mRNA increased in response to cyclic tensile strain following transfection with p21 siRNA, whereas the expression of aggrecan was decreased. Phospho-STAT3 and MMP-13 protein levels increased following downregulation of p21, and this was reversed by treatment with a STAT3 inhibitor. p21-deficient mice were susceptible to OA, and this was associated with increased STAT3 phosphorylation, elevated MMP-13 expression, and elevation of synovial inflammation. The expression of p21 mRNA was decreased and phosphorylation of STAT3 was elevated in human OA chondrocytes. The lack of p21 has catabolic effects by regulation of aggrecan and MMP-13 expression through STAT3 phosphorylation in the cartilage tissue. p21 may function as a regulator of transcriptional factors other than the inhibitor of cell cycle progression in the cartilage tissue. Thus, the regulation of p21 may be a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of OA.']]"

The expression of matrix metalloproteinases 3 and 13 (MMP-3 and MMP-13), ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP), osteoprotegerin, and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. MMP-3 and MMP-13 release was assessed by Western blot analysis. IL-1β increased the mRNA levels of MMP-3 and MMP-13 and ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 and release of MMP-3 and MMP-13. Seven days of HA treatment significantly prevented the IL-1β-increased mRNA levels of MMP-3 (-61%, p < 0.01), MMP-13 (-56%, p < 0.01), ADAMTS-4 (-58%, p < 0.05), ADAMTS-5 (-52%, p < 0.01), and RANKL (-49%, p < 0.05), but not TIMP. As well, IL-1β-induced production of MMP-3 and MMP-13 was inhibited, by 27% (p < 0.01) and 40% (p < 0.01), respectively. In an inflammatory context in murine osteoblasts, HA can inhibit the expression of MMP and ADAMTS. Because HA can counteract the production of these mediators in chondrocytes, its beneficial effect in osteoarthritis may be due to its action on cartilage and subchondral bone.']]"

The cell growth was determined using cell counting kit-8; gene and protein expressions were analyzed by Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. Co-treatment with IL-1β and hypoxia decreased cell viability in human nucleus pulposus cells. There was a positive effect of IL-1β on human nucleus pulposus cells under hypoxia, which was through the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), MMP-13, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS)-4, and ADAMTS-5. IL-1β-induced expressions of MMP-3, MMP-9, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 under hypoxia were accompanied by increased activation of NF-κB. Inhibition of NF-κBp65 by small interfering RNA or specific inhibitor BAY11-7082 blocked IL-1β-dependent gene upregulation of MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 in a hypoxic environment. The gene expression of aggrecan was decreased by IL-1β under hypoxic conditions, which was reversed by either BAY11-7082 or NF-κBp65 knockdown. IL-1β and hypoxia synergetically contributed to the catabolic effects of the nucleus pulposus cells by upregulating the expression of MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 through the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway, indicating that the NF-κB signaling pathway is a key mediator of intervertebral disc degeneration.']]"

Our recent studies have demonstrated that the human fetal membranes are capable of de novo synthesis of serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), an acute phase protein, and the abundance of SAA1 in the amnion was increased at parturition. However, the exact role of SAA1 in human parturition remains to be established. The effects of SAA1 on the abundance of collagenases and lysyl oxidase, the enzyme that cross-links collagens, were investigated in culture primary human amnion fibroblasts and tissue explants with an aim to examine the involvement of SAA1 in the ECM remodeling in the amnion. Serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) time- and dose-dependently increased the abundance of collagenases MMP-1, MMP-8, and MMP-13, while decreased the abundance of lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL1). These effects of SAA1 were attenuated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and its antagonist CLI-095, but not by siRNA-mediated knockdown of TLR2. Furthermore, the inhibitors for NF-κB (JSH-23) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38 (SB203580) and JNK (SP600125) could also attenuate the effects of SAA1, while the inhibitor for MAPK ERK1/2 (PD 98059) could block the effects of SAA1 only on MMP-1, MMP-8, and LOXL1 but not on MMP-13.

Enamel matrix derivative (EMD), clinically used for periodontal regeneration in a device called Emdogain, has been suggested to enhance gingival healing following periodontal procedures in humans. We previously showed that EMD increases the proliferation of human and rat gingival fibroblasts and protects them from tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis. In the present study, the modulation of MMP and TIMP expression by EMD was investigated. Primary human gingival fibroblasts were treated in vitro with tumor necrosis factor, EMD or both in serum-free conditions, and RNA was analyzed with an extracellular matrix-focused microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Microarray analysis showed detectable expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7 and MMP-13, as well as TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 in untreated cells. There was no apparent regulation of the expression of MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-13 and TIMP-1 by either tumor necrosis factor or EMD. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor significantly increased MMP-1 expression, and EMD reduced it when both agents were present. Also, EMD significantly induced TIMP-3 expression, an effect which was dependent on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, since it was totally abolished by a selective extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway inhibitor. These data suggest that EMD may affect gingival health by ways other than cell proliferation/survival, i.e. by stimulation of TIMP-3 production, which could improve the MMP-TIMP balance in gingival tissue and curb extracellular matrix destruction.']]"

In primary chondrocytes, furin reduced the expression of MMP-13, which was reversed by treatment with the furin inhibitor α1-PDX. Furin also promoted the activation of Smad3 signaling, whereas activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) knockdown mitigated the effects of furin on MMP-13 expression.

These results support a protective role for furin in OA by maintaining ALK5 receptor levels and reducing MMP-13 expression. Therefore, furin might be a potential target mediating the development of OA.']""]]"

MMP-13, MMP-3, and TIMP-1 were expressed strongly in the TMJ soon after injury; MMP-13 became gradually weakened, and MMP-3 strengthened later. None of these were expressed in the normal condyle. After a month the surface of the arthrotic condyle was uneven, and the underlying collagen fibrils were exposed in irregular fissures on the surface. The secretion of TIMP-1 was related closely to the changes of MMPs during osteoarthrosis of the TMJ.

Treatment with the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, GM6001, during the first week after cryoinjury resulted in impaired heart regeneration, as indicated by the larger scar and reduced numbers of proliferating cardiomyocytes. GM6001 also significantly reduced the number of leukocytes to the IA at 0.5 dpc to 4 dpc.

However, chemokine rescue with recombinant CXCL8 and CCL2 restored the recruitment of macrophages and the cardiac regenerative capability in GM6001-treated fish. MMP-9 and MMP-13 cleaved zebrafish CXCL8 at the same site, and the truncated form was more chemotactic than the intact form. In contrast, CCL2 did not have an MMP-9 or MMP-13 cleavage site.

Further, from E13.0 to 14.0, in the developing tibial cartilage, MMP-2, -14, and TIMP-2 mRNAs were expressed in the periosteum/perichondrium, but weak MMP-14 and no TIMP-1 mRNA expression was recognized in the perichondrium. These results confirmed that the perichondrium of condylar cartilage has characteristics of periosteum, and suggested that MMPs and/or TIMPs are more actively involved in the development of condylar (secondary) cartilage than tibial (primary) cartilage. MMP-9-positive cells were observed in the bone collar of both types of cartilage, and they were consistent with osteoclasts/chondroclasts. MMP-13 mRNA expression was restricted to the chondrocytes of the lower hypertrophic cell zone in tibial cartilage at E14.0, indicating MMP-13 can be used as a marker for lower hypertrophic cell zone. It was also expressed in chondrocytes of newly formed condylar cartilage at E15.0, and continuously expressed in the lower hypertrophic cell zone until E18.0. These results confirmed that progenitor cells of condylar cartilage are rapidly differentiated into hypertrophic chondrocytes, which is a unique structural feature of secondary cartilage different from that of primary cartilage.']""]]"
170,171) Ginsenoside Rb1 inhibits matrix metalloproteinase 13 through down-regulating Notch signaling pathway in osteoarthritis.,"[[""171) ['Mounting evidence suggests that an excess of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) plays an important role in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in osteoarthritis (OA). Here, the effects of ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1) on the expression of MMP-13 in IL-1β-induced SW 1353 chondrosarcoma cells and an experimental rat model of OA induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) were investigated. SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells were pretreated with or without GRb1 and Notch signaling pathway inhibitor, DAPT, then were stimulated with IL-1β. In rats, experimental OA was induced by ACLT. These rats then received intra-articular injections of vehicle, an inhibitor of γ-secretase, DAPT, and/or GRb1. Expression of MMP-13, collagen type II (CII), Notch1, and jagged 1 (JAG1) were verified by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. In addition, levels of MMP-13 mRNA were detected using quantitative real-time PCR. In histological analyses, treatment with DAPT reduced the number of cartilage lesions present and the expressions of MMP-13, CII, Notch1, and JAG1. In addition, treatment with GRb1 was associated with lower levels of Notch1 and JAG1 in both IL-1β-induced SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells and in the rat OA model. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of GRb1 on MMP-13 was greater than that exhibited by the signaling pathway inhibitor. In conclusion, GRb1 inhibits MMP-13 through down-regulating Notch signaling pathway in OA. ']""]]"
171,172) Regulation of programmed-death ligand in the human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma microenvironment is mediated through matrix metalloproteinase-mediated proteolytic cleavage.,"[[""172) ['Recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) is a devastating malignancy with a poor prognosis. According to recent clinical studies, tumour growth can be effectively reduced and survival can be improved by blocking the programmed death receptor-1\\xa0(PD-1)/programmed death-ligand\\xa01\\xa0(PD‑L1) pathway. PD-L1 expression has been proposed as a potential causative mechanism, as HNSCC is highly immunosuppressive. However, anti-PD-1 treatment is beneficial only for certain patients. Therefore, the mechanisms controlling PD-L1 expression warrant further investigation in order to provide a better understanding of the predicting efficacy of and optimising anti-PD-1 therapy, alone or in combination. In this study, PD-L1 protein extracted from the cell membrane was found to be downregulated in OSC-20 cells compared with OSC-19 cells, despite a higher PD-L1 expression in the total cell lysate of the OSC-20 compared with the OSC-19 cells. Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were found to be upregulated in HNSCC; in particular, MMP-7 and -13 were upregulated in the OSC-20 compared with the OSC-19 cells. Purified PD-L1 was degraded by recombinant MMP-13 and -7. The expression of PD-L1 was significantly restored by a specific inhibitor of MMP-13 (CL82198), which suggested the involvement of MMP-13 in the shedding/cleavage of PD-L1 in the OSC-20 cells. Among the anticancer drugs conventionally used in the treatment of patients with HNSCC, paclitaxel increased MMP-13 expression in R/M HNSCC cells (HOC313 cells) co-cultured without/with dendritic cells (DCs). These results suggest that the shedding/cleavage of PD-L1 by MMP-13 is one of the mechanisms behind the protective effect against invasion and metastasis. Thus, MMP-13 has potential value as a marker predictive of the decreased efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. In addition, paclitaxel is a particularly promising candidate for combination therapy in R/M HNSCC with anti-PD-1 therapy.']""]]"

The results are consistent with those of cell test showing that MC-LR treatment enhanced migration and invasion of DLD-1, HT-29, and SW480 cells and are also correlated with the increased mRNA and protein levels of MMP-13 by Quantitative real-time PCR, Luciferase assay, and Western blot assay respectively in DLD-1 cells and HT-29 cells after MC-LR exposure. In addition, MMP-13 siRNA inhibited MC-LR induced migration and invasion enhancement and MMP-13 over-expression in DLD-1 cells and HT-29 cells. This is the first paper confirming MC-LR-induced MMP-13 expression can promote colorectal cancer invasion and migration. Further investigation revealed that phosphorylation of AKT increased in MC-LR-treated cells, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt. (PI3-K/AKT) inhibitor LY294002 effectively abolished MC-LR-enhanced migration and invasion and MMP-13 expression. Therefore, based on these observations, we concluded that the activation of PI3K/AKT by MC-LR results in MMP-13 expression, leading to the migration and invasion of DLD-1 cells and HT-29 cells. The study provides a mechanistic insight into the promoting colorectal cancer functions of MC-LR.']""]]"

The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of allopurinol to prevent experimental cirrhosis. Fibrosis and cirrhosis were induced by common bile duct ligation (BDL) for 4 weeks in rats. Animals were divided into 4 groups: sham-operated rats (SHAM); BDL group; BDL plus allopurinol (100 mg·kg⁻¹, p.o.), and SHAM plus allopurinol treatment. Alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase were increased in BDL rats but were preserved normal by allopurinol. XO activity was prevented by allopurinol; however, lipophilic and hydrophilic oxidative stress was not prevented by the drug. Allopurinol partially suppresses nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) expression, and increased the active form of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). Moreover, collagen production induced by BDL was partially but significantly reduced by allopurinol. These findings suggest that allopurinol possesses a hepatoprotective effect probably by modulating proteins such as NF-κB, TGF-β, and MMP-13, helping to protect against liver damage induced by chronic cholestasis and a mechanism independent of oxidative stress.']""]]"

Five siRNA oligomers targeting rat TIMP-1 were designed and transfected into HSCs. A U6 promoter followed by the siRNA which had the strongest suppression effect was cloned into the AAV vector and packed into 293 cells to construct the recombinant AAV/siRNA-TIMP-1/neo. After infecting HSCs with this recombinant AAV, the transcription and expression levels of the TIMP-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) genes were detected at 4 and 12 weeks. Three of the five designed siRNA oligomers had a suppressing effect on TIMP-1 expression in rat HSCs within 72 h. The transcription and expression levels of TIMP-1 were suppressed significantly (P<0.05) following recombinant AAV/siRNA1-TIMP-1/neo infection and lasted 12 weeks. TIMP-1 expression in rAAV/siRNA1-TIMP-1/neo-infected HSCs was suppressed by 60% after four weeks and 90% after twelve weeks when compared to the control recombinant AAV/neo and uninfected HSCs. Furthermore, the transcription and protein expression levels of MMP-13, the main substrate of TIMP-1, were elevated by approximately 40% at twelve weeks in rAAV/siRNA-TIMP-1/neo-infected HSCs.

176,"177) Serotonin-induced MMP-13 production is mediated via phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and ERK1/2 in rat uterine smooth muscle cells.","[[""177) ['Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), acting via the 5-HT(2A) receptor, up-regulates the transcription and production of interstitial collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-13; MMP-13), a critical enzyme responsible for maintaining the integrity of the uterus, after parturition. Serotonin treatment of rat uterine myometrial smooth muscle cells induced inositol phosphate (IP) turnover, which was abolished by the 5-HT(2A) receptor-specific antagonists ketanserin and spiperone. The phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitors and D609 attenuated serotonin-mediated-IP turnover with a corresponding inhibition of MMP-13 protein production. Subsequent recovery of both MMP-13 protein expression and IP generation was seen following the removal of D609. Protein kinase C (PKC) activators, the diacylglycerol analogue 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), mimicked the effect of serotonin on MMP-13 protein expression; prolonged PMA treatment (which down-regulates PKC) lowered MMP-13 protein levels. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I, calphostin C, CGP 41251, and the PKCdelta-selective inhibitor rottlerin were able to suppress serotonin up-regulation of MMP-13. Furthermore, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 blocked serotonin-dependent activation of p44/42 MAPK (pERK1/2), a downstream effector of PKC and also down-regulated MMP-13 protein expression. Similarly, calphostin C and rottlerin depressed activation of p44/42 MAPK. From these studies, serotonin, binding through the 5-HT(2A) receptor, initiates a signaling cascade whereby stimulation of PLC leads to the activation of PKC and subsequently the ERK1/2 pathway, which ultimately results in MMP-13 production.']""]]"

In this work, we have constructed an expression vector and a recombinant adenovirus harboring human MMP-13 cDNA to investigate the role of MMP-13 in cancer cell invasion. Our results show that constitutive expression of MMP-13 by HT-1080 cells stably transfected with MMP-13 expression vector or transduced with MMP-13 adenovirus markedly increased their invasion both through type I collagen and reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) with no alterations in expression or activation of collagenase-1 (MMP-1), gelatinase-A (MMP-2), or gelatinase-B (MMP-9). The enhanced invasion capacity of MMP-13 expressing HT-1080 cells was dependent on MMP activity, as it was blocked by MMP inhibitor Batimastat (BB-94) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3).

To determine whether MMP-13 is a target of miR-127-5p, dual luciferase reporter assays were performed. miR-127-5p mimic and miR-127-5p inhibitor were used to overexpress or downregulate miR-127-5p expression in human NP cells, respectively. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knock down MMP-13 expression in human NP cells.

The expression of Mmp-2, Mmp-3, Mmp-13, Mmp-14, Timp-1, and Timp-2 as well as PGE2 was determined. Inhibitors of MAPKs, PI3K/Akt, NF-kB and Cox-2 were employed to reveal possible TNF-α induced regulatory signalling pathway(s). The mRNA and protein expression were analysed by (semi)quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. TNF-α dose-dependently stimulated MMP-3 expression by cementoblasts. This was found for mRNA as well as protein expression. No significant differences were found in the mRNA expression of Mmp-2, Mmp-13, Mmp-14, Timp-1, and Timp-2 upon TNF-α stimulation. The level of PGE2, however, was significantly increased along with MMP-3. Treatment with a selective Cox-2 inhibitor resulted in partial suppression of TNF-α-induced Mmp-3 mRNA expression. Addition of PGE2 enhanced Mmp-3 mRNA in a dose dependent manner, suggesting an inductive effect of TNF-α partly via PGE2. The up-regulation of Mmp-3 by TNF-α was completely suppressed by a combination of NF-kB and p38 MAPK inhibitors, while partial suppression was found with each inhibitor. The effect of PGE2 on Mmp-3 expression was abolished by treating cells with an NF-kB inhibitor; a p38 MAPK inhibitor had only a small effect. The present study indicates that cementoblasts respond to TNF-α by increasing MMP-3 production partially via PGE2 and signalling through the NF-kB and p38 MAPK pathway.

This study aimed to explore the role of SIRT1 in regulating MMP-13 expression induced by P.e LPS in osteoblasts. P.e LPS stimulated MMP-13 expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. Knockdown of SIRT1 reinforced the increase of MMP-13mRNA expression induced by P.e LPS. SIRT1 activator resveratrol significantly reduced the expression of MMP-13 and SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 enhanced the expression of MMP-13. Moreover, SIRT1 activation with resveratrol inhibited acetylation of NF-κB p65 and NF-κB transcriptional activity, which were enhanced by P.e LPS. In addition, NF-κB p65 was involved in P.e LPS-induced MMP-13 expression via directly binding to the MMP-13 promoter. However, SIRT1 activation significantly interfered with this binding. These findings strongly suggest that P.e LPS induces MMP-13 expression in osteoblasts, and SIRT1 suppresses this expression of MMP-13 through targeting NF-κB p65.

The mRNA (COX-2, iNOS, MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-5, Sox-9, aggrecan and collagen-II) and protein expression (COX-2, iNOS, MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-5 and SIRT1) were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot respectively. Immunofluorescence was used to assess the expression of collagen-II and SIRT1. SIRT1 activity was quantified with SIRT1 fluorometric assay kit. The in vivo effect of fisetin was evaluated by gavage in mice OA models induced by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). We found that fisetin inhibited IL-1β-induced expression of NO, PGE2, TNF-α, IL-6, COX-2, iNOS, MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-5. Besides, fisetin remarkably decreased IL-1β-induced degradation of Sox-9, aggrecan and collagen-II. Furthermore, fisetin significantly inhibited IL-1β-induced SIRT1 decrease and inactivation. However, the inhibitory effect of fisetin was obvious abolished by sirtinol, suggesting that fisetin exerts anti-inflammatory effects through activating SIRT1. In vivo, fisetin-treated mice exhibited less cartilage destruction and lower OARSI scores. Moreover, fisetin reduced subchondral bone plate thickness and alleviated synovitis. Taken together, these findings indicate that fisetin may be a potential agent in the treatment of OA.']""]]"
188,"189) Distinct expression of gelatinase A [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2], collagenase-3 (MMP-13), membrane type MMP 1 (MMP-14), and tissue inhibitor of MMPs type 1 mediated by physiological signals during formation and regression of the rat corpus luteum.","[[""189) ['The corpus luteum (CL) is a transient endocrine organ that secretes progesterone to support pregnancy. The CL is formed from an ovulated follicle in a process that involves extensive angiogenesis and tissue remodeling. If fertilization does not occur or implantation is unsuccessful, the CL will undergo regression, which involves extensive tissue degradation. Extracellular proteases, such as serine proteases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), are thought to play important roles in both the formation and regression of the CL. In this study, we have examined the physiological regulation pattern and cellular distribution of messenger RNAs coding for gelatinase A (MMP-2), collagenase-3 (MMP-13), membrane type MMP 1 (MT1-MMP, MMP-14), and the major MMP inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of MMPs type 1 (TIMP-1) in the CL of adult pseudopregnant (psp) rat. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that gelatinase A messenger RNA was mainly expressed during luteal development, indicating that gelatinase A may be associated with the neovascularization and tissue remodeling that takes place during CL formation. Collagenase-3 had a separate expression pattern and was only expressed in the regressing CL, suggesting that this MMP may be related with luteal regression. MT1-MMP that in vitro can activate progelatinase A and procollagenase-3 was constitutively expressed during the formation, function, and regression of the CL and may therefore be involved in the activation of these MMPs. TIMP-1 was induced during both the formation and regression of the CL, suggesting that this inhibitor modulates MMP activity during these processes. To test whether the induction of collagenase-3 and TIMP-1 is coupled with luteal regression, we prolonged the luteal phase by performing hysterectomies, and induced premature luteal regression by treating the pseudopregnant rats with a PGF2alpha analog, cloprostenol. In both treatments, collagenase-3 and TIMP-1 were induced only after the serum level of progesterone had decreased, suggesting that collagenase-3 and TIMP-1 are induced by physiological signals, which initiate functional luteolysis to play a role in tissue degradation during structural luteolysis. In conclusion, our data suggest that gelatinase A, collagenase-3, and MT1-MMP may have separate functions during the CL life span: gelatinase A mainly takes part in CL formation, whereas collagenase-3 mainly takes part in luteal regression; MT1-MMP is constitutively expressed during the CL life span and may therefore serve as an in vivo activator of both gelatinase A and collagenase-3. TIMP-1 is up-regulated both during the formation and regression of the CL and may therefore regulate MMP activity during both processes.']""]]"

The protein levels of Col2, aggrecan, Akt, p-Akt and MMP-13 were evaluated by Western blotting. Results Compared with the control OA group, the expressions of Col2 and aggrecan at both mRNA and protein levels significantly increased, and MMP-13 significantly reduced in the LIPUS-treated OA group. The p-Akt protein level was significantly elevated after LIPUS stimulation, but there was no significant difference in the Akt protein levels between the two groups. Moreover, LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt, significantly suppressed the biological effect activated by LIPUS. Conclusion LIPUS enhances the synthesis and inhibits the degradation of the extracellular matrix in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes.']""]]"

It is reported that PAR-2 expression is significantly increased in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissue compared with the adjacent non-neoplastic kidney tissue. However, the function of PAR-2 in regulating cell invasion and migration of RCC remains elusive. In this study, we found that PAR-2 was overexpressed in RCC cells. Activation of PAR-2 with PAR-2AP (PAR-2 agonist) enhanced the invasion and migration of RCC cells, and increased the expressions of MMP-13 and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). However, knockdown of PAR-2 by siRNA could intervene in all regulating effects of PAR-2AP. Furthermore, activation of PAR-2 induced the activation of PI3K and AKT, and PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 attenuated the invasion and migration of RCC cells stimulated by PAR-2 activation. Altogether, our study demonstrates that PAR-2 stimulates the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway, subsequently increasing the expressions of MMP-13 and uPA, and thereby promotes the invasion and migration of RCC cells.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can be inhibited by a multitude of compounds, including hydroxamic acids. Studies have shown that materials and compounds containing trivalent metal ions, particularly potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) (K3[Fe(CN)6]), exhibit cdMMP-13 inhibitory potential with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.3μM. The target protein was obtained by refolding the recombinant histidine-tagged cdMMP-13 using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The secondary structures of the refolded cdMMP-13 with or without metal ions were further analyzed via circular dichroism and the results indicate that upon binding with metal ions, an altered structure with increased domain stability was obtained. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments demonstrated that K3[Fe(CN)6]is able to bind to MMP-13 and endothelial cell tube formation tests provide further evidence for this interaction to exhibit anti-angiogenesis potential. To the best of our knowledge, no previous report of an inorganic compound featuring a MMP-13 inhibitory activity has ever been reported in the literature. Our results demonstrate that K3[Fe(CN)6] is useful as a new effective and specific inhibitor for cdMMP-13 which may be of great potential for future drug screening applications. ']""]]"

Effects of WIN-55 were studied on IL-1β stimulated production of MMP-3 and -13 and their inhibitors TIMP-1 and -2 in human chondrocytes. Chondrocytes were obtained from articular cartilage of patients undergoing total knee replacement. Chondrocytes were grown in monolayer and 3D alginate bead cultures. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine the gene expression of MMP-3, -13, TIMP-1 and -2 and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to measure the amount of MMP-3 and MMP-13 protein released into media. Immunocytochemistry was used to investigate the expression of cannabinoid receptors in chondrocyte cultures.

Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference techniques were used to knockdown the LRP1 gene. Subsequently, the effects of LRP1 on TNF-α-induced MMP-13 expression were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis and ELISA. Furthermore, the TNF-α-induced intracellular pathway was investigated using a nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibitor (Bay 11-7082). In addition, the effect of LRP1 regulation on growth and apoptosis in chondrocytes was investigated using western blot analysis and a TUNEL assay. LRP1 knockdown was shown to increase TNF-α-induced MMP-13 expression via the activation of the NF-κB (p65) pathway, which reduced the expression of collagen type II and cell viability. In addition, LRP1 inhibited cell apoptosis by increasing the expression of phospho-Akt and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), while suppressing the expression of caspase-3 and Bcl-2-associated X protein.

203,204) Zoledronate upregulates MMP-9 and -13 in rat vascular smooth muscle cells by inducing oxidative stress.,"[['204) [ Bisphosphonates, including zoledronate, target osteoclasts and are widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone resorption diseases, despite side effects that include damaging the stomach epithelium. Beneficial and adverse effects on other organ systems, including the cardiovascular system, have also been described and could impact on the use of bisphosphonates as therapeutic agents. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are major constituents of the normal vascular wall and have a key role in intimal thickening and atherosclerosis, in part by secreting MMPs that remodel the extracellular matrix and cleave cell surface proteins or secreted mediators. In this study, we investigated the effects of zoledronate on MMP expression. Rat VSMCs were stimulated by PDGF (50 ng/mL) plus TNF-α (10 ng/mL) or left unstimulated for a further 24 hours in serum-free medium. In other series of experiments, cells were pre-treated either with SC-514 (50 μM) or with apocynin (20 nM) for 2 hours, then zoledronate (100 μM) was added into 2% fetal calf serum containing medium for 24 hours. Using isolated rat VSMCs in culture, zoledronate (100 μM) increased MMP-9 and -13 mRNA expressions but inhibited MMP-2 expression. MMP-9 and MMP-13 up-regulation was shown to depend on the NF-κB pathway; and this was activated by zoledronate. Furthermore, zoledronate elevated the levels of reactive oxygen species detected by either dichlorofluorescein in isolated VSMCs or lucigenin enhanced chemiluminescence in rat aortic rings in vitro. Apocynin, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, reversed NF-κB activation and MMP-9 and MMP-13 up-regulation by zoledronate.

204,205) Collagenase-2 (MMP-8) and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) in adult periodontitis: molecular forms and levels in gingival crevicular fluid and immunolocalisation in gingival tissue.,"[['205) [ To determine the cellular and molecular forms of MMP-8 (collagenase-2) and MMP-13 (collagenase-3) associated with chronic adult periodontitis by examining the species present in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and enzyme distribution in gingival tissue. 30-s GCF samples were collected directly from the periodontal pockets of 12 untreated patients using filter paper strips. After elution into buffer, the samples were examined by Western immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies for MMP-8 and MMP-13 and quantification by scanning image analysis. Individual band intensities were expressed as a percentage of total sample absorbance and mean patient values were calculated. Gingival tissue from 6 patients was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. MMP-8 and MMP-13 were localised using the same antibodies and an avidin-biotin-peroxidase detecting system. Double staining was performed with a contrasting substrate reaction. The majority of MMP-8 staining in pre-treatment GCF was present in 80, 75 and 60 kD bands corresponding to prepro-, pro- and active forms of PMN-type enzyme. 43 and 38 kD bands evidently represented active, fibroblast-type MMP-8. Immunoreactivities at >100 kD and < or =30 kD were probably enzyme-inhibitor complex and degraded fragments, respectively. MMP-13 was seen mainly as 60 kD proenzyme with some 40 kD active enzyme and a small proportion of >100 kD complex. The percentages of MMP-8 PMN-type enzyme and MMP-13 proenzyme bands correlated significantly with gingival and bleeding indices (p<0.05). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated MMP-8 in PMNs, sulcular epithelial and also plasma cells in inflamed gingival connective tissue. MMP-13 immunoreactivity was detected in the sulcular epithelium and in macrophage-like cells. Multiple species and elevated levels of both MMP-8 and MMP-13 from many rather than single cellular sources in the diseased periodontium are identified in untreated periodontitis GCF and active forms contribute to GCF collagenase activity.']]"
205,206) Association between mediators in the tear fluid and the severity of keratoconus.,"[['206) [ To study the association between different types of mediators in the tear fluid and topographic indices characterizing the severity of keratoconus (KC).

Release of mediators was calculated from their concentrations and the volume of tears collected over 2 min. Significant positive associations were found between CCL5, MMP-13 and NGF and several topographic indices. Significant negative correlations were found between IL-6 and KCI. Age-dependent associations were observed between IL-13, CXCL8, CCL5 and MMP-13 and the topographic data. Several correlations were observed between the mediators and the topographic indices, suggesting possible roles in the pathophysiology of KC. Our data indicate that some mediators have different effects on the severity of disease in an age-dependent manner.']]"

In OA, dysregulated gene expression and phenotypic changes in articular chondrocytes culminate in progressive loss of cartilage from the joint surface. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. We examined periostin expression by immunohistochemical analysis of lesional and nonlesional cartilage from human and rodent OA knee cartilage. In addition, we used small interfering (si)RNA and adenovirus transduction of chondrocytes to knock down and up-regulate periostin levels, respectively, and analyzed its effect on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, a disintegrin and MMP with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS)-4, and type II collagen expression. We found high periostin levels in human and rodent OA cartilage. Periostin increased MMP-13 expression dose [1-10 µg/ml (EC50 0.5-1 μg/ml)] and time (24-72 h) dependently, significantly enhanced expression of ADAMTS4 mRNA, and promoted cartilage degeneration through collagen and proteoglycan degradation. Periostin induction of MMP-13 expression was inhibited by CCT031374 hydrobromide, an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous periostin blocked constitutive MMP-13 expression. These findings implicate periostin as a catabolic protein that promotes cartilage degeneration in OA by up-regulating MMP-13 through canonical Wnt signaling.']""]]"

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are thought to be involved in tumor progression, and they are also associated with the reactive stroma, which provides structural and vascular support for tumor growth. MMP-2, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP were expressed at both the mRNA and protein levels in tumor samples. MMP-2 and MMP-9 immunohistochemical reactions were evident both in the epithelial tumor cells and in the stromal compartment to varying degrees; in particular, the intensity of the MMP-2 staining was stronger in the stromal fibroblasts close to epithelial tumor cells in simple carcinomas than in adenomas. These data were supported by gelatin-zymography; bands for the active form of MMP-2 were found in 94% of carcinoma samples, compared with 17% of benign tumor samples. The gene expression and immunohistochemical results for MT1-MMP were comparable to those for MMP-2. The immunoreactivity for MMP-13 and TIMP-2 was lower in carcinomas than in adenomas, confirming the mRNA data for MMP-13 and the other MMP inhibitors that were evaluated. The active form of MMP-9, but not the active form of MMP-2, was identified in the plasma of all of the tested dogs. Our findings suggest that MMP-9, MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, which are synthesized by epithelial cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, play an important role in malignant canine mammary tumors. The reduction of MMP-13 and TIMP-2 could also be a significant step in malignant transformation. MMP-2 and MT1-MMP could be further evaluated as future biomarkers for predicting the progression and prognosis of canine mammary tumors.']]"

Using a recombinant IL-1alpha at 5 ng/ml, it was shown that IL-1alpha would upregulate, while IL-1Ra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, would down-regulate the expression of IL-1alpha mRNA in MG2 cells, indicating the presence of an autostimulatory loop of IL-1alpha in these cells. Besides, a paracrine source of IL-1 may be produced from Kupffer cells, as we showed primarily cultured Kupffer cells responded much more remarkably than MG2 cells to lipopolysaccharide stimuli to produce both IL-1alpha and IL-1beta. Recombinant IL-1alpha upregulated the expression of both MMP-9 and -13, and the induction of MMP-13 but not MMP-9 could be inhibited by SB203580, an inhibitor of p38. Similarly, in primarily cultured human liver MFs, upregulation of MMP-1 by IL-1alpha was also shown to be inhibited by SB203580. All of these data suggested that, during liver inflammation, IL-1 produced by an autocrine model from MFs or by a paracrine model from Kupffer cells might play a crucial role in the remodeling of liver fibrosis through an either p38-dependent or p38-independent pathway to regulate the expression of various MMPs by liver MFs.']""]]"

The rat model of OA was established by anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) transection, and an automatic immuno-analyzer was applied to detect the bone metabolism indexes in the serum. The levels of relevant inflammatory factors in the joint fluid and serum were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cartilage specimens were collected to determine the expression of miR-181 in OA and normal cartilage tissues. Meanwhile, isolated cartilage cells were cultured and transfected with miR-181 mimics and inhibitor separately, and a blank control group was also included. Quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was adopted to detect the messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of inflammatory factors [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] in the cartilage cells. The expression levels of NF-κB and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) proteins related to the NF-κB signaling pathway were determined via Western blotting. In OA model group, the content of serum osteocalcin (OSTEOC) and vitamin D (VD) declined markedly (p<0.05), the content of parathyroid hormone (PTH) increased notably (p<0.05), whereas the change of β-Cross Laps was not significant. ELISA results showed that the levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and MMP-9 were elevated remarkably in OA model group (p<0.05). Compared with that in normal cartilage tissues, miR-181 expression was increased evidently in OA cartilage tissues (p<0.05). Moreover, miR-181 expression was also significantly elevated in miR-181 mimics group after transfection (p<0.05). The expressions of inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-6 in the cartilage cells were increased remarkably in miR-181 mimics group compared with those in control group (p<0.05).

The goal of this study was to determine how PI-3 kinase-Akt signaling regulates these seemingly opposing functions. Monolayer cultures of primary human articular chondrocytes were treated with IGF-1, IL-1β, OSM, or the combination of IL-1β and OSM in time course experiments. Activation of signaling proteins and MMP production were measured by immunoblotting. Cells were pre-treated with chemical inhibitors to block mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases, PI-3 kinase, or JAK/STAT pathway activation. Constitutively active Akt1 and Akt3 were expressed to study stimulus-independent activation of Akt. IGF-1, OSM, and the combination of IL-1β and OSM but not IL-1β alone, stimulated phosphorylation of Akt which was sustained longer with IGF-1. IL-1β plus OSM, but not IGF-1, increased chondrocyte MMP-13 production which was inhibited with either a general PI-3 kinase inhibitor or specific inhibition of the PI-3 kinase-γ isoform. Akt1 or Akt3 activity alone was not sufficient to increase production of MMP-13. IL-1β/OSM induced MMP-13 production required activation of the MAP kinases, JNK and p38, as well as the JAK-STAT pathway which were activated by IL-1β plus OSM but not by IGF-1. The chondrocyte integrates signals from the PI-3 kinase-Akt pathway with signals from MAP kinases and the JAK-STAT pathway to allow for a differential response to a pro-anabolic (IGF-1) and a pro-catabolic (IL-1β plus OSM) stimulus.']]"

Wnt-3a, beta-catenin (24 h,48 h,72 h) and MMP-13(72 h) genes expression were detected by Rt-PCR, while beta-catenin, MMP-13, Sox-9 and coll-II (48 h) protein expression were measured by Western-blot. After induction of IL-1beta, gene expression of Wnt-3a, beta-catenin and MMP-13 were increased,so were the protein expression of beta-catenin and MMP-13. In contrast,protein expression of Sox-9 and Coll-II were declined. Following addition of HBP-A, Wnt-3a, beta-catenin and MMP-13 were shown as induction of IL-1beta, but protein expression of Sox-9 and Coll-II were upgraded. Combining HBP-A with IWP-2 led to the lowest level in Wnt-3a, beta-catenin gene and beta-catenin protein expression and highest expression of Sox-9 protein. HBP-A could not only delay the differentiation of chondrocytes through downgrading the signal expression of Wnt/beta-catenin,but also adjust the expression of Wnt-3a, beta-catenin and Sox-9 when combinated with the Wnt inhibitor.']]"

It is known that increased levels of metalloproteinases (MMPs) in liver fibrosis are associated with reduction of the pathologic ECM and fibrosis resolution. Recently, it has been shown that bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) may reduce collagen and α-SMA expression, and ameliorate liver function in cholestatic rats. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13, and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs)-1 and TIMP-2 in the liver of cholestatic rats transplanted with BMMNC. Animals were divided into normal rats, cholestatic rats obtained after 14 and 21 days of bile duct ligation (BDL), and rats obtained after 14 days of BDL that received BMMNCs and were killed after 7 days. MMP and TIMP expression was assessed by Western blotting, along with α-SMA, CD68 and CD11b expression by confocal microscopy. Western blotting analysis showed that 14-day BDL animals had significantly reduced amounts of MMP-2 and MMP-13, but increased amounts of MMP-9 compared to normal rats. After 21 days of BDL, overall MMP amounts were decreased and TIMPs were increased. BMMNC transplantation significantly increased MMP-9 and MMP-13, and decreased TIMP expression. Increased MMP activity was confirmed by zymography. MMP-9 and MMP-13 were expressed by macrophages near fibrotic septa, suggesting BMMNC may stimulate MMP production in fibrotic livers, contributing to ECM degradation and hepatic regeneration.']""]]"

Selectivity of the probes was demonstrated in vitro using MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-12, and MMP-13. In vivo activation of the probes was tested in the zymosan-induced mouse model of inflammation, and probe specificity was evaluated by the MMP inhibitor GM6001 and specific synthetic inhibitors of MMP-12 and MMP-13. The probes were used to monitor these enzyme activities in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in vivo. The MMP-12 and MMP-13 activity probes (MMP12ap and MMP13ap, respectively) discriminated between the activities of the 2 enzymes. The in vivo activation of these probes was inhibited by GM6001 and by their respective specific inhibitors. In the CIA model, MMP12ap activation peaked 5 days after disease onset and showed strong correlation with disease severity during this time (r = 0.85, P < 0.0001). MMP13ap activation increased gradually after disease onset and correlated with disease severity over a longer period of 15 days (r = 0.58, P < 0.0001). We generated two selective FRET probes that can be used to monitor MMP-12 and MMP-13 activities in live animals. MMP12ap follows the initial stage of inflammation in CIA, while MMP13ap follows the progression of the disease.

Here, we investigated a potential role for Wnt signaling and functional cross-talk with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 in mRNA expression of MMPs, TIMPs and bone matrix proteins in pluripotent C2C12 cells. To assess the functional contribution of Wnt signaling, we have generated C2C12 cell lines stably over-expressing Wnt3a or Wnt5a, and then treated these cells with BMP-2 for 24 h. In these cultures, MMP-13 mRNA expression was induced by BMP-2 in Wnt3a over-expressing C2C12 (Wnt3a-C2C12) cells but not in either Wnt5a over-expressing C2C12 (Wnt5a-C2C12) cells or vehicle-transfected C2C12 cells. MMP-13 mRNA was induced in these cells by addition of BMP-2 for 12 h and the enhancement lasted up to 48 h. These effects were observed in a dose-dependent manner. Enzymatic activity of MMP-13 also induced in Wnt3a-C2C12 cells by addition of BMP-2. However, membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and MMP-2 mRNA expression was not affected by either Wnt3a or BMP-2. In contrast, TIMP-1 mRNA expression was suppressed by BMP-2 in Wnt3a-C2C12 cells but not in Wnt5a-C2C12 cells. Our results show that expression of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 is regulated by Wnt signaling combined with BMP-2 in osteoblastic differentiation, and this signaling may in part mediate MMP-13 and TIMP-1 production during bone formation and/or remodeling.']""]]"

Rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque with superimposed thrombosis is the main cause of acute coronary syndromes, including acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina. The stability of the plaque depends on its collagen content; degradation of the collagen leads to a vulnerable plaque that is prone to rupture. Recent studies have demonstrated a critical role for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the degradation of the collagen content and the reduction of mechanical stability of the atherosclerotic plaques. Increased expression of various MMPs has been shown in the tissue sections of atherosclerotic plaques. The increased expression of MMPs in the atheroma also leads to increased MMP levels in the circulation. The cholesterol lowering drugs - 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) - decrease the tissue expression of various MMPs in atheromatous plaques by attenuating the inflammatory process that promotes MMP expression during the course of atherosclerosis.

N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (Ac-SDKP) is a small peptide that inhibits cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. However, its role in MMP regulation is not known. Thus, we hypothesized that Ac-SDKP promotes MMP activation in cardiac fibroblasts and decreases collagen deposition via this mechanism. To that end, we tested the effects of Ac-SDKP on interleukin-1β (IL-1β; 5 ng/ml)-stimulated adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. We measured total collagenase activity, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13 expressions, and activity along with their inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2. In order to examine the effects of Ac-SDKP on the signaling pathway that controls MMP transcription, we also measured nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Ac-SDKP did not alter collagenase or gelatinase activity in cardiac fibroblasts under basal conditions, but blunted the IL-1β-induced increase in total collagenase activity. Similarly, Ac-SDKP normalized the IL-1β-mediated increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and MMP-13 expression. Inhibition of MMPs by Ac-SDKP was associated with increased TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expressions. Collagen production was not affected by Ac-SDKP, IL-1β, or a combination of both agents. Ac-SDKP blocked IL-1β-induced p42/44 phosphorylation and NFκB activation in cardiac fibroblasts. We concluded that the Ac-SDKP-inhibited collagenase expression and activation was associated with increased expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. These pharmacological effects of Ac-SDKP may be linked to the inhibition of MAPK and NFκB pathway.']""]]"

Western blotting assay was used to detect the expressions of NF-κB1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13).According to results from human OA samples and rat OA models, miR-9 was significantly downregulated in knee OA cartilage tissues compared with normal cartilage tissues (P\\u200a<\\u200a0.01). The expressions of NF-κB1, IL-6, and MMP-13 in knee OA cartilage tissues were significantly higher than those in normal cartilage tissues (P\\u200a<\\u200a0.01). Dual luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-9 could bind to the 3\'UTR of NF-κB1 and significantly inhibit the luciferase activity by 37% (P\\u200a<\\u200a0.01). Upregulation of miR-9 or downregulation of NF-κB1 could promote cell proliferation and suppress cell apoptosis.Conclusively, downregulated miR-9 can facilitate proliferation and antiapoptosis of knee OA chondrocytes by directly binding to NF-kB1, implying that stimulating miR-9 expressions might assist in treatment of knee OA.

We focused on two important topics in QSAR: bioactive conformation and descriptors. Firstly, molecular docking was carried out to dock all molecules into the MMP-13 active site in order to obtain the bioactive conformation. Secondly, based on the docked complex, descriptors characterizing receptor-ligand interactions and the ligand structure were calculated. Thirdly, a genetic algorithm (GA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were employed to select important descriptors related to inhibitory activities, simultaneously, to build the predictive model. The built model gave satisfactory results with highly accurate fitting and strong external predictive abilities for chemicals not used in model development. Furthermore, the selected descriptors were explored to elucidate important factors influencing the inhibition activities. This study demonstrates that the selection strategy of the docking-guided bioactive conformation is rational and useful in predicting MMP-13 inhibitor activities, and receptor-ligand complex descriptors have an advantage over directly reflecting receptor-ligand interactions.']""]]"

Mechanistically, we found that sodium butyrate abolished the activation of NF-κB by inhibiting phosphorylation of IKK, IκBα, and NF-κB p65. Based on these observations, we conclude that butyrate may have potential as a therapeutic agent for OA.']""]]"
223,"224) ITZ-1, a client-selective Hsp90 inhibitor, efficiently induces heat shock factor 1 activation.","[['224) [""ITZ-1 is a chondroprotective agent that inhibits interleukin-1beta-induced matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) production and suppresses nitric oxide-induced chondrocyte death. Here we describe its mechanisms of action. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) was identified as a specific ITZ-1-binding protein. Almost all known Hsp90 inhibitors have been reported to bind to the Hsp90 N-terminal ATP-binding site and to simultaneously induce degradation and activation of its multiple client proteins. However, within the Hsp90 client proteins, ITZ-1 strongly induces heat shock factor-1 (HSF1) activation and causes mild Raf-1 degradation, but scarcely induces degradation of a broad range of Hsp90 client proteins by binding to the Hsp90 C terminus. These results may explain ITZ-1\'s inhibition of MMP-13 production, its cytoprotective effect, and its lower cytotoxicity. These results suggest that ITZ-1 is a client-selective Hsp90 inhibitor.""]']]"
224,225) Effects of chronic sleep deprivation on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in the temporomandibular joint of rats.,"[['225) [ To examine the possible involvement and regulatory mechanisms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) of rats subjected to chronic sleep deprivation (CSD). Rats were subjected to CSD using the modified multiple platform method (MMPM). The serum levels of corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were tested and histomorphology and ultrastructure of the TMJ were observed. The ERK and phospho-ERK (p-ERK) expression levels were detected by Western blot analysis, and the MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 expression levels were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting. The elevated serum CORT and ACTH levels confirmed that the rats were under CSD stress. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed pathological alterations in the TMJ following CSD; furthermore, the p-ERK was activated and the mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 were upregulated after CSD. In the rats administered with the selective ERK inhibitor U0126, decreased tissue destruction was observed. Phospho-ERK activation was visibly blocked and the MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 mRNA and protein levels were lower than the corresponding levels in the CSD without U0126 group. These findings indicate that CSD activates the ERK pathway and upregulates the MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 mRNA and protein levels in the TMJ of rats. Thus, CSD induces ERK pathway activation and causes pathological alterations in the TMJ. ERK may be associated with TMJ destruction by promoting the expression of MMPs.']]"
225,226) Parathyroid hormone regulates histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4 through protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in osteoblastic cells.,"[[""226) ['Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are crucial regulators of gene expression in transcriptional co-repressor complexes. Previously, we reported that HDAC4 was a basal repressor of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) transcription and parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates HDAC4 to control MMP-13 promoter activity through dissociation from Runx2. Here, we show that PTH induces the protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of HDAC4 in the nucleus of the rat osteoblastic cell line, UMR 106-01. We demonstrate that PKA-dependent phosphorylated HDAC4 is released from Runx2 bound to the MMP-13 promoter in these cells. Point mutation of Ser-740 in rHDAC4 prevents the release of HDAC4 from Runx2 on the MMP-13 promoter and also prevents the PTH stimulation of MMP-13 transcription. Thus, PTH-induced phosphorylation of rHDAC4 at Ser-740 is crucial for regulating MMP-13 transcription in osteoblasts. PTH causes degradation of HDAC4, and this product appears in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic degradation of HDAC4 is blocked by PKA and lysosomal inhibitors, but is not affected by proteasome, caspase-3, or serine and aspartic protease inhibitors. In addition, the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, prevents degradation indicating that dephosphorylation is associated with degradation. These mechanisms regulating HDAC4 and their roles in such processes are crucial for bone and chondrocyte development. Our data support a link between PTH regulating HDAC4 phosphorylation by PKA, trafficking, partial degradation, and the control of MMP-13 transcription through association with Runx2. ']""]]"

MMP-8 was assayed by immunofluorometric assay (IFMA) and ELISA. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed-effects models and Bayesian statistics in R and Stata V11. MMP-8, MPO, azurocidin and total MMP-13 and MMP-14 were higher in periodontitis compared to gingivitis and healthy sites (p < 0.05). A very high correlation between MPO and MMP-8 was evident in the periodontitis group (r = 0.95, p < 0.0001). MPO, azurocidin and total levels of MMP-8, MMP-13 and MMP-14 showed high diagnostic accuracy (≥0.90), but only MMP-8 and MPO were significantly higher in the periodontitis versus gingivitis sites. MMP-8 determined by IFMA correlated more strongly with periodontal status and showed higher diagnostic accuracy than ELISA. MPO and collagenolytic MMPs are highly discriminatory biomarkers for site-specific diagnosis of periodontitis. The comparison of two quantitative MMP-8 methods demonstrated IFMA to be more accurate than ELISA.']]"

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease with an inflammatory component that drives the degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix. This study aimed to assess the effects of cordycepin on human OA chondrocytes. In this study, human OA chondrocytes were pretreated with cordycepin at 10, 50 or 100 μM and subsequently stimulated with interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (5 ng/ml) for 24 h. Production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO) were evaluated by the Griess reaction and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclo-oxygenase (COX-2) was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MMP-13 and IL-6 proteins in culture medium were determined using cytokine-specific ELISA. Western immunoblotting was used to analyse the iNOS and COX-2 protein production in culture medium. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) activity regulation was explored using Western immunoblotting. Pretreatment with cordycepin significantly inhibited the production of PGE2 and NO induced by IL-1β. Cordycepin also significantly decreased the IL-1β-stimulated gene expression and production of MMP-13, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2 in OA chondrocytes. Pretreatment with cordycepin attenuated IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB by suppressing degradation of its inhibitory protein nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (IκB-α) in the cytoplasm. We show for the first time the anti-inflammatory activity of cordycepin in human OA chondrocytes.

228,229) Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 is principally responsible for fibroblast growth factor 2-induced catabolic activities in human articular chondrocytes.,"[['229) [ Cartilage degeneration driven by catabolic stimuli is a critical pathophysiological process in osteoarthritis (OA). We have defined fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) as a degenerative mediator in adult human articular chondrocytes. Biological effects mediated by FGF-2 include inhibition of proteoglycan production, up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), and stimulation of other catabolic factors. In this study, we identified the specific receptor responsible for the catabolic functions of FGF-2, and established a pathophysiological connection between the FGF-2 receptor and OA. Primary human articular chondrocytes were cultured in monolayer (24 hours) or alginate beads (21 days), and stimulated with FGF-2 or FGF18, in the presence or absence of FGFR1 (FGF receptor 1) inhibitor. Proteoglycan accumulation and chondrocyte proliferation were assessed by dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay and DNA assay, respectively. Expression of FGFRs (FGFR1 to FGFR4) was assessed by flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The distinctive roles of FGFR1 and FGFR3 after stimulation with FGF-2 were evaluated using either pharmacological inhibitors or FGFR small interfering RNA (siRNA). Luciferase reporter gene assays were used to quantify the effects of FGF-2 and FGFR1 inhibitor on MMP-13 promoter activity. Chondrocyte proliferation was significantly enhanced in the presence of FGF-2 stimulation, which was inhibited by the pharmacological inhibitor of FGFR1. Proteoglycan accumulation was reduced by 50% in the presence of FGF-2, and this reduction was successfully rescued by FGFR1 inhibitor. FGFR1 inhibitors also fully reversed the up-regulation of MMP-13 expression and promoter activity stimulated by FGF-2. Blockade of FGFR1 signaling by either chemical inhibitors or siRNA targeting FGFR1 rather than FGFR3 abrogated the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases 13 (MMP-13) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS5), as well as down-regulation of aggrecan after FGF-2 stimulation. Flow cytometry, qPCR and immunoblotting analyses suggested that FGFR1 and FGFR3 were the major FGFR isoforms expressed in human articular chondrocytes. FGFR1 was activated more potently than FGFR3 upon FGF-2 stimulation. In osteoarthritic chondrocytes, FGFR3 was significantly down regulated (P < 0.05) with a concomitant increase in the FGFR1 to FGFR3 expression ratio (P < 0.05), compared to normal chondrocytes. Our results also demonstrate that FGFR3 was negatively regulated by FGF-2 at the transcriptional level through the FGFR1-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signaling pathway in human articular chondrocytes. FGFR1 is the major mediator with the degenerative potential in the presence of FGF-2 in human adult articular chondrocytes. FGFR1 activation by FGF-2 promotes catabolism and impedes anabolism. Disruption of the balance between FGFR1 and FGFR3 signaling ratio may contribute to the pathophysiology of OA.']]"

In this study we have investigated the relationship between the MRC dysfunction and the regulation of metalloproteases (MMPs) in human normal chondrocytes in culture. Human normal chondrocytes were isolated from human knees obtained form autopsies of donors without previous history of rheumatic disease. Rotenone, 3-Nitropropionic acid (NPA), Antimycin A (AA), Sodium azide and Oligomycin were used to inhibit the activity of the mitochondrial complexes I, II, III, IV and V respectively. The mRNA expression of MMPs -1, -3 and -13 was studied by real time PCR. The intracellular presence of MMP proteins was evaluated by western blot. The liberation of these proteins to the extracellular media was evaluated by ELISA. The presence of proteoglycans in tissue was performed with tolouidin blue and safranin/fast green. Immunohistochemistry was used for evaluating MMPs on tissue. Firstly, cells were treated with the inhibitors of the MRC for 24 hours and mRNA expression was evaluated. An up regulation of MMP-1 and -3 mRNA levels was observed after the treatment with Oligomycin 5 and 100 μg/ml (inhibitor of the complex V) for 24 hours. MMP-13 mRNA expression was reduced after the incubation with AA 20 and 60 μg/ml (inhibitor of complex III) and Oligomycin. Results were validated at protein level observing an increase in the intracellular levels of MMP-1 and -3 after Oligomycin 25 μg/ml stimulation [(15.20±8.46 and 4.59±1.83 vs. basal=1, respectively (n=4; *P<0.05)]. However, AA and Oligomycin reduced the intracellular levels of the MMP-13 protein (0.70±0.16 and 0.3±0.24, respectively vs. basal=1). In order to know whether the MRC dysfunction had an effect on the liberation of MMPs, their levels were evaluated in the supernatants. After 36 hours of stimulation, values were: MMP-1=18.06±10.35 with Oligomycin 25 μg/ml vs. basal=1, and MMP-3=8.49±4.32 with Oligomycin 5 μg/ml vs. basal=1 (n=5; *P<0.05). MMP-13 levels in the supernatants were reduced after AA 60 μg/ml treatment (0.50±0.13 vs. basal=1) and Oligomycin 25 μg/ml (0.41±0.14 vs. basal=1); (n=5; *P<0.05). The treatment of explants with Oligomycin, showed an increase in the positivity of MMP-1 and -3. Explants stimulated with AA or Oligomycin revealed a decrease in MMP-13 expression. Proteoglycan staining demonstrated a reduction of proteoglycan levels in the tissues treated with Oligomycin. These results reveal that MRC dysfunction modulates the MMPs expression in human normal chondrocytes demonstrating its role in the regulation of the cartilage destruction.']]"

231,232) CpG ODN-induced matrix metalloproteinase-13 expression is mediated via activation of the ERK and NF-κB signalling pathways in odontoblast cells.,"[['232) [ To investigate the effects of CpG ODN (CpG oligodeoxynucleotides) to model the action of bacterial challenge on pulpal matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) expression and elucidate the associated intracellular signalling pathways. Real-time PCR was used to detect the effects of CpG ODN on MMP-13 mRNA expression levels in a murine odontoblast-lineage cell line (OLCs). The possible involvement of TLR9/MyD88, NF-κB or MAPK pathways involved in the CpG ODN-induced MMP-13 expression was examined by real-time PCR, transient transfection, luciferase activity assay and ELISA. Western blotting was performed to assay the phosphorylation of ERK at a range of time points. MMP-13 was constitutively expressed in OLCs, and their exposure to CpG ODN significantly increased MMP-13 expression. Pre-treatment of OLCs with the inhibitory peptide MyD88, or chloroquine, attenuated the CpG ODN-induced expression of MMP-13. Treatment of the OLCs with CpG ODN increased NF-κB-luciferase activity. This activity was decreased by the over-expression of a nondegrading mutant of IκBα (IκBαSR), although enhanced by the over-expression of NF-κB p65. MMP-13 expression induced by CpG ODN was markedly suppressed by NF-κB inhibitors (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, PDTC), IκBα phosphorylation inhibitors (Bay 117082) or IκB protease inhibitor (L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, TPCK). The inhibitor of ERK1/2, U0126, but not inhibitors of p38 MAPK and JNK, SB203580 and SP600125, decreased CpG ODN-mediated MMP-13 expression. The CpG ODN-induced MMP-13 expression in OLCs is mediated through TLR9, NF-κB and the ERK pathway indicating that potentially the recognition of CpG ODN by TLR9 on odontoblasts may regulate the remodelling of injured dental pulp and hard tissues by inducing MMP-13 expression.']]"

The baseline A-SAA level but not the ESR or the CRP level correlated with the 28-joint swollen joint count and was independently associated with 1-year radiographic progression (P = 0.038). A-SAA increased MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, and MMP/TIMP expression in RA FLS and synovial explants (P < 0.05).

Gelatin zymography revealed that A-SAA induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity. Blockade of the A-SAA receptor SR-B1 (A-SAA receptor scavenger receptor-class B type 1) inhibited MMP-3, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression in synovial explant cultures ex vivo. Importantly, we demonstrated that A-SAA has the ability to induce TNFα expression in RA synovial explant cultures (P < 0.05). A-SAA may be involved in joint destruction though MMP induction and collagen cleavage in vivo.

An increasing linear trend over time was found for MMP-9, EGF, and CXCL8 in KC and MMP-9, MMP-13, IL-6, and CXCL8 in group III. Significant differences were observed in the linear trend over time between groups I and III for MMP-13 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1; between groups I and II for MMP-9 and CXCL8; and between groups III and II for MMP-9, CXCL8, and MMP-13.

HMGB1 alone failed to induce IL-6, MMP-3, and MMP-13 production in cultured SF but greatly enhanced LPS-induced expression of IL-6, MMP-3, and MMP-13 at both mRNA and protein levels. HMGB1-LPS synergistically upregulated TLR4 and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) expression on the surface of SF.

239,240) Pivotal role of matrix metalloproteinase 13 in extracellular matrix turnover in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,"[['240) [ Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). We investigated the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs) in lung fibrosis. MMP and TIMP expression, collagenolytic activity and collagen content was assessed in IPF (n=16) versus donor (n=6) lung homogenates and accomplished by in-situ-zymography for gelatinolytic and collagenolytic activities, combined with MMP antigen detection. Role of MMP13 was assessed employing the bleomycin model of lung fibrosis in MMP-13(-/-) versus wild-type mice. In IPF, MMPs-1, 2, 7, 9 and 13, but not MMP-8, were significantly upregulated, whereas none of the TIMPs (1-4) were significantly altered. Collagen content was slightly increased and collagenolytic activity was most prominent in the airways and co-localized with MMP-13. We observed an exaggerated early inflammatory response and an augmented lung fibrosis in bleomycin-challenged MMP-13(-/-) versus wild-type mice, with elevated lung collagen content 28d after bleomycin challenge in the MMP-13(-/-) mice. Our data suggest that i) collagen deposition in IPF lungs is not primarily due to excessive TIMP production, but rather due to overwhelming ECM production in face of an overall increased, but spatially imbalanced collagenolytic activity, ii) preferential distribution of collagenolytic activity, largely MMP-13, in the airways offers an explanation for the development of honeycomb cysts and iii) despite an overall increase in inflammatory cell content the presence of MMP-13 seems to limit the overall extent of ECM deposition in lung fibrosis.']]"

MicroRNA-127-5p suppressed IL-1β-induced MMP-13 production as well as the activity of a reporter construct containing the 3\'-UTR of human MMP-13 mRNA. In addition, mutation of the miR-127-5p binding site in the 3\'-UTR of MMP-13 mRNA abolished miR-127-5p-mediated repression of reporter activity. Conversely, treatment with anti-miR-127-5p remarkably increased reporter activity and MMP-13 production.

In this study, we synthesized SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) and SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) drug-loaded poly(ethylene glycol)-block-caprolactone copolymer via dialysis method. The physical property of micelles was characterized through dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The cell growth and LPS-induced MMP-2 and MMP-13 expression were evaluated through CCK-8, real-time PCR and Western blot assay. The release of SP600125 and SB203580 from different scaffolds was estimated. Microcomputed tomography and histology were used for evaluating the effect of the micelles-loaded nanofibers on the treatment of class II furcation defects in dogs. The drug was then successfully incorporated into gelatin fibers during electrospinning process. We confirmed that the micelles had spherical structure and an average particle size of 160 nm for SP600125-micelles (SP-Ms) and 150 nm for SB203580-micelles (SB-Ms). The nanofiber scaffold showed excellent encapsulation capability, in vitro drug-release behavior, and cell compatibility.

NR4A messenger RNA levels in synovial tissue and primary synoviocytes were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). NR4A2 was stably overexpressed in normal synoviocytes, and cell proliferation, survival, anchorage-independent growth, migration, and invasion were monitored in vitro. MMP and TIMP expression levels were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, and MMP-13 promoter activity was measured using reporter assays. Stable depletion of endogenous NR4A levels was achieved by lentiviral transduction of NR4A short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and the effects on proliferation, migration, and MMP-13 expression were analyzed. NR4A2 was expressed at elevated levels in normal, OA, and RA synovial tissue and in primary RA synoviocytes. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) rapidly and selectively induced expression of NR4A2 in synoviocytes. Ectopic expression of NR4A2 in normal synoviocytes significantly increased proliferation and survival, promoted anchorage-independent growth, and induced migration and invasion. MMP-13 gene expression was synergistically induced by NR4A2 and TNFα, while expression of TIMP-2 was antagonized. NR4A2 directly transactivated the proximal MMP-13 promoter, and a point mutation in the DNA binding domain of NR4A2 abolished transcriptional activation. Depletion of endogenous NR4A receptors with shRNA reduced synoviocyte proliferation, migration, and MMP-13 expression. The orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2 is a downstream mediator of TNFα signaling in synovial tissue. NR4A2 transcriptional activity contributes to the hyperplastic and invasive phenotype of synoviocytes that leads to cartilage destruction, suggesting that this receptor may show promise as a therapeutic target in inflammatory arthritis.']]"
243,244) Inhibiting autophagy promotes collagen degradation by regulating matrix metalloproteinases in pancreatic stellate cells.,"[['244) [ Autophagy is an intracellular metabolic process that degrades and recycles own constituents to maintain homeostasis and supply substrates.

Rats were injected dibutyltin dichloride (DBTC) to induce chronic pancreatitis (CP) model. The expression of LC3B was measured by western blotting. Rat PSCs were isolated from pancreas tissues, and the experiments used the primary PSCs. Autophagosome was confirmed by transmission electron microscope. Immunofluorescence for LC3B and α-SMA were applied to assess autophagy and activated PSCs. The effects of autophagy inhibition of 3-MA on the expressions of LC3B, Atg5, and Beclin-1 were investigated by real-time PCR and Western blotting, as well as the α-SMA, TGF-β1, ColI, Col III, FN, MMP-2, MMP-13, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Meanwhile, the secretion of ColI, Col III and FN were investigated by ELISA. The LC3-II/I ratio was increased in rat CP model. Autophagosomes and an increased autophagic level were observed during PSCs activation. Inhibiting autophagy could down-regulate the expressions of α-SMA, TGF-β1, FN, ColI, Col III, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, while the expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-13 were increased. This study confirmed that autophagic level is increased during PSCs activation in vivo and in vitro. Inhibiting autophagy prevents the activation of PSCs, and suppresses fibrosis through promoting extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation by decreasing the expression of TGF-β1 and increasing MMPs/TIMPs ratio.']]"

The viability and proliferation of tenocytes, their genes expression, and the signaling pathways after ultrasound treatment with or without specific inhibitors were evaluated and analyzed. The results showed that ultrasound treatment (100 mW/cm(2) for 20 min) significantly enhanced matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), c-Fos, and c-Jun gene expression, increased JNK and p38, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), phosphorylation at 5 min, and sustained up to 60 min. JNK inhibitor and p38 inhibitor, but not ERK1/2 inhibitor, attenuated ultrasound-dependent induction of MMP-13 expression, indicating that the JNK and p38 pathways are required for ultrasound-induced MMP-13 expression in tenocytes. We also found that SB431542 (transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) receptor kinases inhibitor) suppressed ultrasound-induced MMP?13 and c-Fos gene expression, and p38 phosphorylation.

In a rabbit model of flexor tendon injury, the mRNA expression for the growth factors, MMPs and TIMPs were measured in tendon and tendon sheath tissue at several time points (3, 6, 21, and 42 days) representing different phases of the healing process. We found that MMP-13 remained increased during the study period, whereas MMP-3 returned to normal levels within the first week after injury. TIMP-3 was down-regulated in the tendon sheaths. Cathepsin K was up-regulated in tendons and sheaths after injury. NGF was present in both tendons and sheaths, but unaltered. IGF-1 exhibited a late increase in the tendons, while VEGF was down-regulated at the later time points. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the presence of NGF in flexor tendons. MMP-13 expression appears to play a more protracted role in flexor tendon healing than MMP-3. The relatively low levels of endogenous IGF-1 and VEGF mRNA following injury support their potential beneficial role as exogenous modulators to optimize tendon healing and strength without increasing adhesion formation.']""]]"

After the 2-week CCl4 injection period, rats in the three siRNA groups simultaneously received a different dosage (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg.kg(-1), respectively) of modified synthetic siRNA targeting TIMP-2 via the tail vein every 3 days for 6 weeks. The pathological changes in liver tissues were observed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Portal vein pressure and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were measured. Expression of TIMP-2, MMP-2, MT1-MMP, MMP-13, hepatocyte growth factor, collagen type I, collagen type III and alpha-SMA were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blotting or gelatin zymography. Modified synthetic siRNA targeting TIMP-2 induced a dose-dependent inhibition of the TIMP-2 expression in the rat model of liver fibrosis with a similar trend in MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, but an increase in MMP-13. Rats administered siRNA targeting TIMP-2 showed promotion of ECM degradation, reduction in activated hepatic stellate cells and enhancement of hepatocyte regeneration. Furthermore, portal hypertension was also ameliorated after treatment with siRNA targeting TIMP-2. Knock-down of TIMP-2 expression attenuates CCl4-induced liver fibrosis and is a potential pharmacological target for gene therapy in liver fibrosis.']]"

Increased FLSs migration and subsequent degradation of the extracellular matrix are essential to the pathology of RA. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS), whose family members include PIAS1, PIAS2 (PIASx), PIAS3, and PIAS4 (PIASy), play important roles in regulating various cellular events, such as cell survival, migration, and signal transduction in many cell types. However, whether PIAS proteins have a role in the pathogenesis of RA is unclear. In this study, we evaluated the role of PIAS proteins in FLSs migration, invasion, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression in RA. We observed increased expression of PIAS3, but not PIAS1, PIAS2, or PIAS4, in FLSs and synovial tissues from patients with RA. We found that PIAS3 knockdown by short hairpin RNA reduced migration, invasion, and MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 expression in FLSs. In addition, we demonstrated that PIAS3 regulated lamellipodium formation during cell migration. To gain insight into molecular mechanisms, we evaluated the effect of PIAS3 knockdown on Rac1/PAK1 and JNK activation. Our results indicated that PIAS3-mediated SUMOylation of Rac1 controlled its activation and modulated the Rac1 downstream activity of PAK1 and JNK. Furthermore, inhibition of Rac1, PAK1, or JNK decreased migration and invasion of RA FLSs. Thus, our observations suggest that PIAS3 suppression may be protective against joint destruction in RA by regulating synoviocyte migration, invasion, and activation. ']""]]"

Low Se and T-2 toxin synergistically affected animal fitness. Interestingly, low Se + T-2 toxin groups showed KBD characteristics. MMP-1, -3, and -13 mRNA and protein levels generally increased in low-Se groups, while collagen II and TIMP-1 levels showed a downward trend, compared with normal diet fed animals for the same treatment (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). T-2 toxin\'s effect was dose but not time dependent. Low Se and T-2 toxin synergistically alter the expression levels of collagen II as well as its regulatory enzymes MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, and TIMP-1, inducing cartilage damage.

The objective of this study was to determine the role of the small GTPase Rac1 in chondrocyte signaling stimulated by FN fragments, which results in MMP-13 production. Normal human cartilage was obtained from tissue donors and OA cartilage from knee arthroplasty specimens. Rac1 activity was modulated with a chemical inhibitor, by knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA), or with constitutively active Rac or dominant-negative Rac adenovirus. Cells were treated with FN fragments, with or without epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transforming growth factor α (TGFα), which are known activators of Rac. Rac1 activity was measured with a colorimetric activity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, a pulldown assay, and immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody against active Rac. Chemical inhibition of Rac1, as well as knockdown by siRNA and expression of dominant-negative Rac, blocked FN fragment-stimulated MMP-13 production, while expression of constitutively active Rac increased MMP-13 production. Inhibition of Rho-associated kinase had no effect. EGF and TGFα, but not FN fragments, increased Rac1 activity and promoted the increase in MMP-13 above that achieved by stimulation with FN fragments alone. Active Rac was detected in OA cartilage by immunostaining. Rac1 is required for FN fragment-induced signaling that results in increased MMP-13 production. EGF receptor ligands, which activate Rac, can promote this effect. The presence of active Rac in OA cartilage and the ability of Rac to stimulate MMP-13 production suggest that it could play a role in the cartilage matrix destruction seen in OA.']]"

Since mechanical stimulation alters expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in chondrocytes, a question addressed herein was, does joint loading alter actions of MMPs in the articular cartilage? We hypothesized that expression and activity of MMPs are regulated in a load-intensity-dependent manner and that moderate load scan downregulates MMPs. To test this hypothesis, a mouse elbow-loading model was employed. In the articular cartilage of an ulna, the mRNA levels of a group of MMPs as well as their degenerative activities were determined. The result revealed that elbow loading altered the expression and activities of MMPs depending on its loading intensity. Collectively, the data in this study indicate that 0.2 and 0.5\\xa0N joint loading significantly reduced the expression of multiple MMPs, that is, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-8, and MMP-13, and overall activities of collagenases or gelatinases in articular cartilage, while higher loads increased the expression and activity of MMP-1 and MMP-13. Furthermore, moderate loads at 1 N elevated the mRNA level of CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail 2 (CITED2), but higher loads at 4 N did not induce a detectable amount of CITED2 mRNA. Since CITED2 is known to mediate the downregulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13, the result indicates that joint loading at moderate intensity reduces MMP activities through potential induction of CITED2. MMPs such as MMP-1 and MMP-13 are predominant collagenases in the pathology of osteoarthritis. Therefore, joint loading could offer an interventional regimen for maintenance of joint tissues.']""]]"

The molecular changes associated with rotator cuff tearing are unclear. A subset of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase, which are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and degradation, were evaluated. There would be an increase in the mRNA level of specific matrix metalloproteinase and a decrease in the mRNA level of specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase in rotator cuff tendon tissue obtained from patients with rotator cuff tears. Controlled laboratory study. Tissue was obtained from 10 patients undergoing rotator cuff repair for full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Also, tissue was obtained from cadaveric specimens with no gross evidence of rotator cuff tearing. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed for the collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-13), the stromelysins (MMP-3, MMP-10, MMP-11), and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, TIMP-4). Western blotting was performed to confirm the mRNA changes demonstrated in collagenase-3 (MMP-13). There was a significant increase in collagenase-3 (MMP-13) mRNA levels, a decrease in stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) mRNA levels, and a decrease in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, -3, and -4 mRNA levels. Western blotting demonstrated an increase in the active form of collagenase-3 (MMP-13) in rotator cuff tendon tears. The mRNA levels of specific matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase are altered in torn rotator cuff tendons. With the known action of the matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase in extra-cellular matrix remodeling, these findings suggest that their roles in remodeling of rotator cuff tears should be further investigated.']]"

Furthermore, very little is known regarding SOCS3 function in cells other than myeloid cells and T cells. Our previous study demonstrates that SOCS3 is expressed in osteoblasts and functions as a critical inhibitor of LPS-induced IL-6 expression. However, the function of SOCS3 in osteoblasts remains largely unknown. In the current study, we report for the first time that LPS stimulation of osteoblasts induces the transcriptional activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, a central regulator of bone resorption. Importantly, we demonstrate that SOCS3 overexpression leads to a significant decrease of LPS-induced MMP-13 expression in both primary murine calvariae osteoblasts and a mouse osteoblast-like cell line, MC3T3-E1.

Little is known about gene expression in meniscal tears, particularly in relation to injury pattern and patient age and sex. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that gene expression in meniscal tears varies depending on patient age and sex and whether the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is also torn. Meniscal tissue from twenty-eight patients with an isolated meniscal tear or a meniscal tear with a concomitant ACL tear was collected at the time of clinically indicated partial meniscectomy. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for molecular markers of osteoarthritis including proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNFα]), chemokines (IL-8, CCL3, CCL3L1, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL6, and CCL20), aggrecanases (ADAMTS-4 [a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type-4 motifs] and ADAMTS-5), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13), transcription factors (NFκB2 [nuclear factor kappa B2], NFκBIA [NF-kappa B inhibitor alpha], and IκBA [inhibitor of kappa B alpha]), and matrix components (bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]-2, type-I collagen alpha 1 [Col1a1], Col2a1, and aggrecan). Expression of IL-1β (p = 0.02), ADAMTS-5 (p = 0.001), MMP-1 (p = 0.007), MMP-9 (p = 0.002), MMP-13 (p = 0.01), and NFκB2 (p = 0.01) was significantly higher in patients with a meniscal tear who were under the age of forty years than it was in those over the age of forty years. Similarly, the expression of ADAMTS-4 (p = 0.002), ADAMTS-5 (p = 0.02), MMP-1 (p = 0.02), and MMP-13 (p = 0.0002) was higher in patients with a meniscal tear and an ACL tear who were under the age of forty years than it was in those over forty years.

The only sex-based difference in gene expression was higher levels of CCL3L1 in female patients (p &lt; 0.05) of all ages with combined injuries. These findings suggest clinically relevant differences in the response of the knee to meniscal tears on the basis of patient age and sex. Elevated expression levels of arthritis-related markers indicate an increased catabolic response in patients under forty years old. Higher expression of catabolic markers in patients with meniscal and ACL tears suggests this combined injury pattern is more likely to lead to the development of osteoarthritis. Catabolic activity in meniscal tissue may predict patients who are at risk for progression of osteoarthritis following partial meniscectomy.']]"

Primary hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are used to investigate the changes in UII/UT expression and the in vitro effect of palosuran. Compared with the vehicle-treated cirrhotic rats, treatment with palosuran can reduce the portal pressure (PP), decrease the risk of liver fibrosis and the level of α smooth muscle actin, collagen-I (COL-I), and transforming growth factor β expression. However, treatment with palosuran can increase MMP-13/TIMP-1, pvasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (p-VASP), and p-eNOS expression. Moreover, in vitro UII/UT mRNA expression increases during HSC activation. MMP-13/TIMP-1, COL-I, and p-VASP are inhibited after palosuran treatment.

We investigated the involvement of HDAC3 in exercise therapy-treated OA. Expression levels of HDAC3, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-5 (ADAMTS-5), matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), HDAC3 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were measured by western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Cartilage damage and OA evaluation were measured by hematoxylin and eosin staining and Toluidine blue O staining according to the Mankin score and OARSI score, respectively. We found that moderate-intensity treadmill exercise could relieve OA.

Furthermore, we found the selective HDAC3 inhibitor RGFP966 could also alleviate inflammation in OA rat model through inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. To further explore the relationship between HDAC3 and NF-kappaB, we investigated the change of NF-kappaB relocation in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes under the stimulation of RGFP966.

Manumycin A, an inhibitor of H-Ras farnesylation by farnesyltransferase, suppressed IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced MMP-13 mRNA and protein expression. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated H-Ras silencing down-regulated MMP-13 mRNA and protein induction by IL-1β and TNF-α. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase/NOX) inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) suppressed cytokine-induced MMP-13 expression and superoxide production. Apocynin, another NOX inhibitor, also diminished MMP-13 induction. Deoxyglucose an antimetabolite of glucose metabolism reduced MMP-13 increase. Role of NOX-mediated ROS production was reaffirmed by the observation that the antioxidants, trolox, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), quercetin and resveratrol downregulated cytokine-induced MMP-13 mRNA and protein expression. These results provide strong pharmacological and genetic evidence for the implication of H-Ras and NADPH oxidase-generated superoxide production in MMP-13 gene regulation by IL-1β and TNF-α.

In addition, IFN-gamma inhibits collagenase-1 (MMP-1) expression in these cells. IFN-gamma abolished the enhancement of MMP-13 and MMP-1 expression by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and inhibited invasion of A-5 cells through type I collagen. IFN-gamma also rapidly and transiently activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1,2 (ERK1,2) and blocking ERK1,2 pathway (Raf/MEK1,2/ERK1,2) by specific MEK1,2 inhibitor PD98059 partially (by 50%) prevents Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT1 and suppression of MMP-13 expression by IFN-gamma. Furthermore, Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT1 by ERK1,2, or independently of ERK1,2 activation is associated with marked reduction in MMP-13 expression.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether LIPUS affects ECM production in normal and OA rabbit chondrocytes through an integrin-p38 signaling pathway. A rabbit model of OA was established by anterior cruciate ligament transection, and chondrocytes were isolated from normal or OA cartilage and cultured in\\xa0vitro.

Expression of type II collagen, MMP-13, integrin β1, p38 and phosphorylated p38 was assessed by Western blot analysis. We found that type II collagen and integrin β1 were upregulated (p < 0.05), whereas MMP-13 was downregulated (p < 0.05) in normal and OA chondrocytes. Furthermore, phosphorylated p38 was upregulated (p < 0.05) in normal chondrocytes, but downregulated (p < 0.05) in OA chondrocytes after LIPUS stimulation. Pre-incubation of chondrocytes with the integrin inhibitor disrupted the effects of LIPUS on normal and OA chondrocytes.

Our initial studies on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-purinergic receptor pathway demonstrated that stimulation by exogenous ATP improved tissue growth and properties but elicited matrix turnover under high doses (250 µM) potentially due to the accumulation of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (ePPi). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the mechanism of ATP-mediated catabolism and determine a therapeutic dose to maximize the anabolic effect. Isolated bovine articular chondrocytes were seeded in high-density, 3-dimensional culture supplemented with varying doses of ATP for 4 weeks. The effects on biosynthesis, matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) protein activity, and PPi accumulation were determined. Separate monolayer experiments were conducted to determine the effect of ePPi on MMP-13 activity. High doses of ATP resulted in an increase in ePPi accumulation (by 54%) and MMP-13 activity (by 39%). Monolayer experiments confirmed a link between increased ePPi accumulation and MMP-13 activity, which appeared to require calcium and was inhibited by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. Cultures supplemented with 62.5 to 125 µM ATP favored an anabolic response, which represented the therapeutic dose range. A therapeutic dose range of exogenous ATP to improve the properties of engineered cartilage has been identified, and a possible catabolic mechanism involving excess PPi was determined.

We found that the MEK inhibitor U0126 and the RSK inhibitor BI-D1870 both reduced IL-1B-dependent MMP-1 gene expression in SW1353 cells. Although ERK is known to phosphorylate CEBPB on threonine 235, this residue was not required for CEBPB-dependent activation of MMP-1. In contrast, the RSK target serine 321 was required for LAP1 and LAP2-dependent activation of MMP-1. These findings establish CEBPB as a critical intermediate for IL-1B-dependent MMP gene activation and assign specific roles for the ERK and RSK kinases in this pathway.']""]]"

Physical blending combined with vacuum freeze-drying method was utilized to prepare the andrographolide-releasing collagen scaffold. The characteristics of scaffold including its surface morphology and porosity were detected with environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) and a density instrument. Then, the release of andrographolide from prepared scaffolds was measured by UV-visible spectroscopy. Rabbit chondrocytes were isolated and cultured <i>in vitro</i> and seeded on andrographolide-releasing collagen scaffolds. Following culture with normal medium for 3 d, seeded chondrocytes were cultured with medium containing interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) to stimulate inflammation <i>in vitro</i> for 7 d. The proliferation, morphology and gene transcription of tested chondrocytes were detected with Alamar Blue assay, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) staining and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test respectively. The results showed that the collagen scaffolds prepared by vacuum freeze-dry possess a high porosity close to 96%, and well-interconnected chambers around (120.7±17.8) μm. The andrographolide-releasing collagen scaffold continuously released andrographolide to the PBS solution within 15 d, and collagen scaffolds containing 2.22% andrographolide significantly inhibit the proliferation of chondrocytes. Compared with collagen scaffolds, 0.44% andrographolide-containing collagen scaffolds facilitate chondrocytes to keep specific normal morphologies following 7 d IL-1β induction. The results obtained by RT-qPCR confirmed this effect by enhancing the transcription of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 ( <i>TIMP-1</i>), collagen II ( <i>COL II</i>), aggrecan ( <i>Aggrecan</i>) and the ratio of <i>COL II</i>/ collagen I( <i>COL I</i>), meanwhile, reversing the promoted transcription of matrix metalloproteinase-1 ( <i>MMP-1</i>) and matrix metalloproteinase-13 ( <i>MMP-13</i>). In conclusion, our research reveals that andrographolide-releasing (0.44%) collagen scaffolds enhance the ability of chondrocytes to maintain their specific morphologies by up-regulating the transcription of genes like <i>COL II</i>, <i>Aggrecan</i> and <i>TIMP-1</i>, while down-regulating the transcription of genes like <i>MMP-1</i> and <i>MMP-13</i> which are bad for phenotypic maintenance under IL-1β simulated inflammatory environment.

Viability and apoptosis were detected by MMT and cytometry, miRNA, MMP-1, MMP-13, and Col2a1 by qRT-PCR and <i>NF-κB</i> activation by immunofluorescence. Visfatin and resistin significantly reduced viability, induced apoptosis, increased <i>miR-34a</i>, <i>miR-155</i>, <i>miR-181a</i>, and <i>miR-let7e</i>, and reduced <i>miR-140</i> and <i>miR-146a</i> gene expression in OA chondrocytes. <i>MMP-1</i>, <i>MMP-13</i>, and <i>Col2a1</i> were significantly modulated by treatment of OA chondrocytes with adipokines. Visfatin and resistin significantly increased NF-κB activation, while the co-treatment with BAY11-7082 did not change <i>MMPs</i> or <i>Col2a1</i> levels beyond that caused by single treatment.

274,275) Interleukin-17F affects cartilage matrix turnover by increasing the expression of collagenases and stromelysin-1 and by decreasing the expression of their inhibitors and extracellular matrix components in chondrocytes.,"[[""275) ['Interleukin (IL)-17, a proinflammatory cytokine, is produced primarily by activated Th17 cells. IL-17 consists of six ligands that signal through five receptors (IL-17Rs); IL-17A and IL-17F share the highest homology in the family. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade the extracellular matrix during cartilage remodeling whereas tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) inhibit the action of MMPs. In the present study, we examined the effect of IL-17F on the degradation and synthesis of the extracellular matrix in cartilage using human articular chondrocytes. We examined the effect of IL-17F on the expression of IL-17Rs, MMPs, TIMPs, type II collagen, aggrecan, link protein, and cyclooxygenases (COXs), as well as on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. We also examined the indirect effect of PGE2 on the above IL-17F-induced/reduced components using NS-398, a specific inhibitor of COX-2. Cells were cultured with or without IL-17F in the presence or absence of either an IL-17R antibody or NS-398 for up to 28 days. Expression of IL-17Rs, MMPs, TIMPs, type II collagen, aggrecan, link protein, and COXs at mRNA and protein levels was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. PGE2 production was determined by ELISA. The expression of all types of IL-17Rs was detected in chondrocytes. However, IL-17RE expression was extremely low, compared with other IL-17Rs. The expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, and COX-2 as well as PGE2 production were increased by addition of IL-17F, whereas the expression of IL-17RD, TIMP-2, TIMP-4, type II collagen, aggrecan, link protein, and COX-1 was decreased. The expression of IL-17RA, IL-17RB, IL-17RC, MMP-2, MMP-14, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 was unaffected by addition of IL-17F. The IL-17R antibody blocked the stimulating/reducing effect of IL-17F on the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, TIMP-2, TIMP-4, type II collagen, aggrecan, and link protein. NS-398 blocked the reducing effect of IL-17F on aggrecan expression, whereas it did not completely block the stimulating/reducing effects of IL-17F on the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, TIMP-2, TIMP-4, type II collagen, and link protein. Our results suggest that IL-17F stimulates cartilage degradation by increasing the expression of collagenases (MMP-1 and -13) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and by decreasing expression of their inhibitors (TIMP-2 and -4), type II collagen, aggrecan, and link protein in chondrocytes. Furthermore, our results suggest that the expression of aggrecan, link protein, and TIMP-4 decrease through the autocrine action of PGE2 in chondrocytes.']""]]"

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are required for regular skin wound healing and the distinctive pattern of their expression has been implicated to promote scarless healing. In this study, we analyzed the temporal and spatial expression patterns of these molecules during the incisional skin wounds in adult nude mice. Macroscopic and histological analyses of skin wounds revealed an accelerated wound healing process, minimal granulation tissue formation and markedly diminished scarring in nude mice. Quantitative RT-PCR (Mmp-2, -3, -8, -9, -10, -12, -13, -14 and Timp-1, -2, -3), Western blots (MMP-13) and gelatin zymography (MMP-9) revealed that MMP-9 and MMP-13 showed a unique, bimodal pattern of up-regulation during the early and late phases of wound healing in nude mice. Immunohistochemically MMP-9 and MMP-13 were generally detected in epidermis during the early phase and in dermis during the late (remodeling) phase. Consistent with these in vivo observations, dermal fibroblasts cultured from nude mice expressed higher levels of types I and III collagen, MMP-9 and MMP-13 mRNA levels and higher MMP enzyme activity than wild type controls. Collectively, these finding suggest that the bimodal pattern of MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression during skin repair process in nude mice could be a major component of their ability for scarless healing.']""]]"

RA FLS migration and invasion in vitro were measured by the Boyden chamber method. Invasion of RA FLS into cartilage was detected in the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse co-implantation model of RA in vivo. PAK1 and MT1-MMP expression were examined by western blotting. ELISA was used to measure the production and activity of MMPs. Phosphorylated PAK1 (p-PAK1) protein expression was increased in ex vivo synovial membrane cells from RA patients. Stimulation with IL-1β or TNF-α up-regulated p-PAK1 expression. Inhibition of PAK1 by transfection with dominant negative PAK1 mutant (dnPAK1) reduced in vitro migration and invasion of RA FLS. In the SCID mouse model, RA FLS invasion into cartilage was attenuated by transfection with dnPAK1 in vivo. PAK1 regulated IL-1β-induced production and activity of MMP-13 and MT1-MMP. Inhibition of MMP-13 or MT1-MMP activity also reduced RA FLS invasion. Furthermore, dnPAK1 transfection inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, but did not affect the activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and p38. Inhibition of the JNK activity by chemical inhibitor significantly reduced the migration, invasion and production of MMP-13 and MT1-MMP. PAK1 plays an important role in regulating the migration, invasion and production and activity of MMPs in RA FLS, which is mediated by the JNK pathway. This suggests a novel strategy targeting PAK1 to prevent joint destruction of RA.']]"

In this study, a cellular OA model was established by stimulating SW1353 cells with interleukin 1β. A rat OA model was generated by transecting the anterior cruciate ligament combined with the resection of the medial menisci, followed by treatment with diazoxide or diazoxide combination with 3-methyladenine. The percentage of viable cells was evaluated using calcein-acetoxymethyl/propidium iodide double staining. The messenger RNA expression levels of collagen type II alpha 1 chain (COL2A1), matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1), and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS5) were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The cartilage thickness and joint space were evaluated using ultrasound. SW1353 cell degeneration and autophagosomes were observed using transmission electron microscopy. The expression levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), beclin-1, P62, COL2A1, and MMP-13 were evaluated using immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis. Diazoxide significantly attenuated articular cartilage degeneration and SW1353 cell death in experimental OA. The restoration of autophagy was observed in the diazoxide-treated group. The beneficial effects of diazoxide were markedly blocked by 3-methyladenine. Diazoxide treatment also modulated the expression levels of OA-related biomarkers. These results demonstrated that diazoxide exerted a chondroprotective effect and attenuated cartilage degeneration by restoring autophagy via modulation of OA-related biomarkers in experimental OA. Diazoxide treatment might be a promising therapeutic approach to prevent the development of OA.']""]]"

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is reported to be associated with wound healing, probably through transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1). A rabbit ACL injury model was used to study the effect of CTGF on ligament recovery. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed for detection of changes in RNA levels of TGF-β1, type 1 collagen (COL1), type 2 collagen (COL2), SRY-related high mobility group-box gene9 (SOX9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP-13). Expression of related proteins was detected by Western blotting. The current study showed that CTGF could promote the recovery of an injured anterior cruciate ligament. It can upregulate mRNA and expression of TGF-β1, COL1, COL2, SOX9, and tissue inhibitor of TIMP-1, and downregulate mRNA and expression of MMP-13, suggesting that the curative effect of CTGF on injured rabbit ligaments is through regulation of these cellular factors.

279,280) β-adrenergic receptor stimulation transactivates protease-activated receptor 1 via matrix metalloproteinase 13 in cardiac cells.,"[['280) [ Chronic β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) overstimulation, a hallmark of heart failure, is associated with increased cardiac expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMP-1 has been shown to cleave and activate the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) in noncardiac cells. In the present study, we hypothesized that β-AR stimulation would result in MMP-dependent PAR1 transactivation in cardiac cells. β-AR stimulation of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) or cardiac fibroblasts with isoproterenol transduced with an alkaline phosphatase-tagged PAR1 elicited a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase-PAR1 cleavage. This isoproterenol-dependent cleavage was significantly reduced by the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001. Importantly, specific MMP-13 inhibitors also decreased alkaline phosphatase-PAR1 cleavage in isoproterenol-stimulated NRVMs, as well as in NRVMs stimulated with conditioned medium from isoproterenol-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts. Moreover, we found that recombinant MMP-13 stimulation cleaved alkaline phosphatase-PAR1 in NRVMs at DPRS(42)↓(43)FLLRN. This also led to the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway through Gαq in NRVMs and via the Gαq/ErbB receptor pathways in cardiac fibroblasts. MMP-13 elicited similar levels of ERK1/2 activation but lower levels of generation of inositol phosphates in comparison to thrombin. Finally, we demonstrated that either PAR1 genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of MMP-13 prevented isoproterenol-dependent cardiac dysfunction in mice. In this study, we demonstrate that β-AR stimulation leads to MMP-13 transactivation of PAR1 in both cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes and that this likely contributes to pathological activation of Gαq and ErbB receptor-dependent pathways in the heart. We propose that this mechanism may underlie the development of β-AR overstimulation-dependent cardiac dysfunction.']]"

There is no easily accessible molecular indicator of early skin UV damage. In this study, we investigated the effects of Syk kinase on MMP expression and evaluated the sensitivity and usefulness of Syk as an early indicator of skin UV damage. Human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were transfected with Syk cDNA to overexpress Syk. MMP-1 expression and Syk activity were determined by Western blot after UV exposure. The effect of Syk on MMP-1 expression in HDFs was further explored by either Syk siRNA or a selective Syk inhibitor. Possible downstream molecules of Syk were also evaluated in HDFs upon UV exposure. The relationship between Syk and collagenase was further explored in vivo (MMP-13, hairless mice). Our studies in HDFs demonstrated that both a Syk inhibitor and Syk siRNA were able to inhibit MMP-1 expression in HDFs exposed to UV and that overexpression of Syk increased MMP-1 expression and the activity of JNK kinase, but not p38 or Erk1/2 MAP kinase. UV exposure enhanced both expression and activity of Syk in HDFs. Experiments with hairless mice suggested that Syk expression is an earlier indicator of UV exposure than MMP-13 expression. Our results demonstrate that Syk expression correlates well with increase of MMPs (MMP-1 in humans and MMP-13 in mice) in response to UV exposure. The findings suggest that Syk may be a novel target for the prevention and treatment of skin photodamage by modulating MMPs.']]"

ATDC5 cells were used to investigate chondrogenic differentiation and terminal calcification. During chondrogenic differentiation, intrinsic sclerostin was upregulated in the early stage, but downregulated in the late stage. Addition of sclerostin elevated expressions of Sox9 and Col2a1 (P<0.05) and reduced expressions of Runx2, Col10a1, MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS5 (P<0.05) through inhibition of the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway (P<0.05).

283,284) Changes in mechanical loading lead to tendonspecific alterations in MMP and TIMP expression: influence of stress deprivation and intermittent cyclic hydrostatic compression on rat supraspinatus and Achilles tendons.,"[['284) [ Tendinopathy commonly occurs in tendons with large in vivo loading demands like the Achilles tendon (AT) and supraspinatus tendon (SST). In addition to differences in their local anatomic environment, these tendons are designed for different loading requirements because of the muscles to which they attach, with the AT experiencing higher loads than the SST. One possible factor in the progression of tendinopathy is the interplay between mechanical loading and the regulation of enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix (matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)) and their inhibitors (tissue inhibitor of metalloprotienases (TIMPs)). Thus, overuse injuries may have different biological consequences in tendons designed for different in vivo loading demands. In this study, the tendon-specific regulation of MMP-13, MMP-3 and TIMP-2 expression in rat AT and SST exposed to two different mechanical environments was investigated. Rat AT and SST were exposed to stress deprivation (ie, detached from attachments) and intermittent cyclic hydrostatic compression (with attachments intact). Levels of MMP-13, MMP-3 and TIMP-2 mRNA were evaluated in time-zero control, attached, stressdeprived and ""compressed"" tendons. Stress deprivation led to elevated expression of MMP-13, MMP-3 and TIMP-2 in both tendons, although the magnitude of the increase was greater for the SST than the AT. Intermittent cyclic hydrostatic compression of attached tendons increased expression of MMP-13 in the SST, but not the AT. The results of this study suggest that stress deprivation may be one contributor to the progression of tendinopathy in AT and SST, where the tendon designed for the lower in vivo loading demand (SST) was the most affected by a change in mechanical loading. The unique upregulation of MMP-13 with hydrostatic compression supports the impingement injury theory for rotator cuff tears.']]"

Two PPARγ ligands, cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14) -prostaglandin-J2 (15d-PGJ2) and synthetic thiazolidinedione compound ciglitazone were examined in this study. Here we found that 15d-PGJ2 and ciglitazone markedly inhibited TNF-α-induced MMP-13 production in human synovial fibroblasts. In addition, activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is strongly associated with MMP-13 induction by TNF-α and the activation of NF-κB was determined by Western blot, reporter assay, and immunofluorescence. It was found that 15d-PGJ2 markedly attenuated the translocation of NF-κB by direct inhibition of the activation of IKK via a PPARγ-independent manner. Ciglitazone also inhibits TNF-α-induced MMP-13 expression by suppressing NF-κB activation mainly via the modulation of p38-MAPK. Collectively, our data demonstrate that 15d-PGJ2 and ciglitazone attenuated TNF-α-induced MMP-13 expression in synovial fibroblasts primarily through the modulation of NF-κB signaling pathways. These compounds may have therapeutic application in inflammatory arthritis.']""]]"
289,290) Optimization of Extracellular Matrix Synthesis and Accumulation by Human Articular Chondrocytes in 3-Dimensional Construct with Repetitive Hydrostatic Pressure.,"[[""290) ['Objective The effects of hydrostatic pressure (HP) on the matrix synthesis by human articular chondrocytes have been reported elsewhere. In order to optimize the production of extracellular matrix, we aimed to clarify the effects of repetitive HP on metabolic function by human articular chondrocytes. Design The human articular chondrocytes were expanded and embedded within a collagen gel/sponge scaffold. We incubated these constructs with and without HP followed by atmospheric pressure (AP) and repeated the second HP followed by AP over 14 days. Genomic, biochemical, and histological evaluation were performed to compare the effects of each regimen on the constructs. Results The gene expressions of collagen type II and aggrecan core protein were significantly upregulated with repetitive HP regimens compared with a single HP or AP by 14 days ( P < 0.01 or 0.05). Matrix metalloptoteinase-13 (MMP-13) in AP was upregulated significantly compared to other HP regimens at day 14 ( P < 0.01). No significant difference was observed in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-II. Immunohistology demonstrated that application of HP (both repetitive and single) promoted the accumulation of specific extracellular matrix and reduced a MMP-13. A single regimen of HP followed by AP significantly increased the amount of sulfated glycosaminoglycan than that of the AP, whereas repetitive HP remained similar level of that of the AP. Conclusions Repetitive HP had a greater effect on anabolic activity by chondrocytes than a single HP regimen, which will be advantageous for producing a matrix-rich cell construct.']""]]"
290,291) Central role of SREBP-2 in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.,"[['291) [ Recent studies have implied that osteoarthritis (OA) is a metabolic disease linked to deregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol efflux. Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors regulating lipid metabolism with so far no association with OA. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that SREBP-2, a gene that plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis, is crucially involved in OA pathogenesis and to identify possible mechanisms of action. ""We performed a genetic association analysis using a cohort of 1,410 Greek OA patients and healthy controls and found significant association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 1784G>C in SREBP-2 gene and OA development. Moreover, the above SNP was functionally active, as normal chondrocytes\' transfection with SREBP-2-G/C plasmid resulted in interleukin-1β and metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) upregulation. We also evaluated SREBP-2, its target gene 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA reductase (HMGCR), phospho-phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K), phospho-Akt, integrin-alphaV (ITGAV) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) mRNA and protein expression levels in osteoarthritic and normal chondrocytes and found that they were all significantly elevated in OA chondrocytes. To test whether TGF-β alone can induce SREBP-2, we treated normal chondrocytes with TGF-β and found significant upregulation of SREBP-2, HMGCR, phospho-PI3K and MMP-13. We also showed that TGF-β activated aggrecan (ACAN) in chondrocytes only through Smad3, which interacts with SREBP-2. Finally, we examined the effect of an integrin inhibitor, cyclo-RGDFV peptide, on osteoarthritic chondrocytes, and found that it resulted in significant upregulation of ACAN and downregulation of SREBP-2, HMGCR, phospho-PI3K and MMP-13 expression levels."" We demonstrated, for the first time, the association of SREBP-2 with OA pathogenesis and provided evidence on the molecular mechanism involved. We suggest that TGF-β induces SREBP-2 pathway activation through ITGAV and PI3K playing a key role in OA and that integrin blockage may be a potential molecular target for OA treatment.']]"
291,292) The effect of gender and genetic polymorphisms on matrix metalloprotease (MMP) and tissue inhibitor (TIMP) plasma levels in different infectious and non-infectious conditions.,"[[""292) ['Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are increased in different infections due to their role in controlling immune responses and are regulated by tissue inhibitors (TIMPs). Different MMP promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) induce changes in MMP genes, mRNA and protein expression. Gender might also modify MMP plasma levels. In order to determine the weight of these variables on MMP secretion we studied MMP-1, -2, -3, -8, -9, -10, -13 and TIMP-1, -2, -4 plasma levels in 90 patients with severe bacterial sepsis, 102 with anti-retroviral (ARV)-treated HIV monoinfection, 111 with ARV-treated HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection and 86 non-infected controls (45 stroke and 41 trauma patients). MMP-1(-1607 1G/2G), MMP-3(-1612 5A/6A), MMP-8(-799C/T), MMP-9(-1562 C/T) and MMP-13(-77A/G) SNPs were genotyped. MMP-3 plasma levels were significantly higher in men than in women in each diagnostic group, and MMP-3 SNP allele 6A carriers also had higher levels than allele 5A carriers, an effect that was magnified by sepsis. Independent predictors of higher MMP-3 levels were male gender (P = 0.0001), MMP-3(-1612 5A/6A) SNP (P = 0.001), higher levels of TIMP-4 (P = 0.004) and MMP-8 (P = 0.006) and lower levels of MMP-1 (P = 0.03) by multivariate analysis. No strong associations with gender or SNPs were observed for other MMPs or TIMPs. In conclusion, male gender and MMP-3(-1612 5A/6A) 6A allele carriage increased MMP-3 plasma levels significantly, especially in patients with severe bacterial sepsis. This confounding gender effect needs to be addressed when evaluating MMP-3 plasma levels in any infectious or non-infectious condition.']""]]"
292,293) Effect of pERK2 on extracellular matrix turnover of the fibrotic joint capsule in a post-traumatic joint contracture model.,"[[""293) ['Lentivirus (LV)-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) has previously been demonstrated to reduce post-traumatic joint contractures: In the present study, the effect of ERK2 siRNA on extracellular matrix turnover within fibrotic joint capsules in post-traumatic joint contractures was examined. Rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups as follows: The non-operated control (CON), operated contracture (ORC) and contracture-treatment (CNT) groups. Representative post-traumatic joint contracture was created through 8 weeks of immobilization following intra-articular injury. In the CNT group, LV-mediated ERK2 siRNA was injected into the model knee at days 3 and 7 after surgery. The posterior joint capsule was examined by western blotting, histology and immunohistochemistry to evaluate alterations in ERK2, phosphorylated (p)ERK2, total collagen, collagen I, collagen III, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-13 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-13. In the ORC group, pERK2 was elevated and total collagen, collagen I, MMP-1 and MMP-13 were significantly increased (P<0.01 vs. CON group); however, these were significantly decreased in the CNT group, and pERK2 was downregulated (P<0.01 vs. ORC group). Collagen III and TIMP-13 were markedly decreased in the ORC group (P<0.01 vs. CON group), but elevated in the CNT group (P<0.01 vs. ORC group). The present res4ults demonstrate unique pathological changes of the fibrotic joint capsule that are responsible for joint contracture following traumatic injury, and reveal that extracellular matrix turnover can be affected by pERK2.']""]]"
293,294) Selective inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-13 increases collagen content of established mouse atherosclerosis.,"[['294) [ Evidence has linked collagen loss with the onset of acute coronary events. This study tested the hypothesis that selective matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) collagenase inhibition increases collagen content in already established and nascent mouse atheromas. In vitro and in situ experiments documented the selectivity and efficacy of an orally available MMP-13 inhibitor (MMP13i-A). In vivo observations monitored macrophage accumulation and MMP-13 activity using molecular imaging. After 10 weeks of MMP13i-A treatment, apolipoprotein E-deficient mice with evolving or established lesions exhibited reduced MMP-13 activity without affecting macrophage content, measured either by intravital microscopy or fluorescence reflectance imaging. Histological analysis indicated that MMP13-iA did not affect plaque size or macrophage or smooth muscle cell accumulation. Administration of MMP13i-A to mice with evolving or established atheromas substantially increased plaque interstitial collagen content in the intima and locally in the fibrous cap, compared with vehicle-treated controls. Analysis of collagen revealed thicker collagen fibers within the plaques of treated groups. ""Pharmacological MMP-13 inhibition yields collagen accumulation in plaques (a feature associated in humans with resistance to rupture), even in established plaques. This study, of considerable clinical relevance, furnishes new mechanistic insight into regulation of the plaque\'s extracellular matrix and validates molecular imaging for studying plaque biology.""']]"
294,295) Matrix metalloproteinase-13 expression in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes by activation of the p38 MAPK/c-Fos/AP-1 and JAK/STAT pathways.,"[[""295) ['Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13, mammalian collagenase) degrades the cartilage matrix in pathological conditions such as osteoarthritis. Here, to establish the signaling pathway to MMP-13 induction, effects of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the possibility of some other signaling pathways involved are investigated in interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-treated human chondrosarcoma cell line, SW1353 cells. IL-1β (10 ng/mL) treatment induced MMP-13 in SW1353 cells, with concomitant activation of nuclear factor-κB, activator protein-1 (AP-1) and MAPKs, including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Among these MAPKs, only p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) blocked MMP-13 induction and AP-1 activation in IL-1β-treated SW1353 cells. SB203580 also inhibited c-Fos translocation to the nucleus (but not c-Jun). Importantly, IL-1β treatment induced Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/2 (STAT1/2) activation. The JAK2 inhibitor (AG490) blocked STAT1/2 activation as well as MMP-13 induction in IL-1β-treated SW1353 cells. STAT1/2 siRNA transfection also reduced MMP-13 expression levels. Thus, from the present study, it is concluded that p38 MAPK/c-Fos/AP-1 and JAK2/STAT1/2 are involved in MMP-13 induction of IL-1β-treated human chondrocytes, SW1353 cells. Blocking these signaling pathways may have chondroprotective effects in cartilage degeneration.']""]]"

An effective MMP-13 inhibitor would provide a disease modifying therapy for the treatment of arthritis, although this goal still continues to elude the pharmaceutical industry due to issues with safety. Our efforts have resulted in the discovery of a series of hydroxamic acid inhibitors of MMP-13 that do not significantly inhibit MMP-2 (gelatinase-1). MMP-2 has been implicated in the musculoskeletal side effects resulting from pan-MMP inhibition due to findings from spontaneously occurring human MMP-2 deletions. Analysis of the SAR of hundreds of previously prepared hydroxamate based MMP inhibitors lead us to 2-naphthylsulfonamide substituted hydroxamates which exhibited modest selectivity for MMP-13 versus MMP-2.

296,297) Prostaglandin EP2 receptor signalling inhibits the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 13 in human osteoarthritic chondrocytes.,"[['297) [ Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 13 is a pathogenic collagenase that causes cartilage destruction and plays a leading role in causing osteoarthritis. This study focused on 114 genes that are differentially expressed between intact and damaged osteoarthritis cartilage, in order to determine which molecules are involved in suppressing MMP-13 expression. MMP-13 concentrations were measured in the supernatant of human osteoarthritis chondrocyte cultures transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against the 114 genes. MMP-13 levels changed most dramatically in response to siRNA against prostaglandin EP2 receptor. The authors performed further measurements of MMP-13 production in osteoarthritis chondrocytes stimulated by the EP2 agonist butaprost in the presence or absence of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and/or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor. They also assessed the effect of butaprost on chondrocyte viability, and investigated the involvement of the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway on EP2 signalling using inhibitors. Cartilage-related gene expression was examined in chondrocytes treated with butaprost. The authors also investigated which E series of prostaglandin (EP) receptors are expressed in osteoarthritis cartilage. MMP-13 messenger RNA expression was significantly affected by two molecules, EP2 receptor and SLC14A1, a urea transporter. In IL-1β-treated osteoarthritis chondrocytes, butaprost suppressed MMP-13 production, which was further decreased by COX-2 inhibitor. EP2 signalling downregulated MMP-13 mRNA expression via the cAMP-PKA pathway without affecting cell viability. Although EP2 signalling enhanced IL-6 expression, the expressions of several catabolic factors (MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS5, IL-1β and tumour necrosis factor alpha) were inhibited. EP2 receptor was the major EP receptor in osteoarthritis cartilage. ""The results suggest that EP2 signalling has \'anti-catabolic\' effects in osteoarthritis chondrocytes.""']]"

Primary varicose vein tissues were obtained from 23 patients, 18 females and 5 males, aged from 19 to 73. Cephalic or basilic veins were obtained for the control group from 10 patients who underwent vascular access for maintenance hemodialysis. Two operative techniques (high ligation with stripping or endovenous laser coagulation) were used. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 13 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-4 in the varicose vein group and control group was assessed semi-quantitatively by immunohistochemical slides stained with primary antibodies. Twenty (87%) of the varicose vein group patients had greater or lesser saphenous vein diseases with reflux. The focal weak (+) stain for matrix metalloproteinases-2, and 13, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-4 was dominant in the varicose vein group; the focal or diffuse strong stain (++ or +++) was prevalent in the control group. The differences were statistically significant (p<0.01). The degree of reflux and the duration of symptoms were not significantly related to the expression of MMP-13 (p=0.317 and p=0.654, respectively). Further study should be performed to investigate the relationship between the clinical characteristics related to venous hypertension or reflux and expression of MMPs and TIMP in varicose veins.']]"
298,299) [Preventive and therapeutic effects of Yiqi Huayu Recipe on degeneration of articular cartilage in rats with osteoarthritis].,"[['299) [ To study the efficacy and possible mechanism of Yiqi Huayu Recipe (YQHYR), a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, in preventing and treating degeneration of the articular cartilage in rats with osteoarthritis (OA). A total of 90 one-month-old SD rats were randomly divided into normal control group, untreated group and YQHYR group, with 30 rats in each group. The osteoarthritis was induced by shoulder disarticulation plus upright posture in rats. The rats in YQHYR group were treated with YQHYR at 5-, 7- and 9-month old (4, 6 and 8 months after the surgery) for one month. Ten rats in each subgroup were sacrificed at 6-, 8- and 10-month old (5, 7 and 9 months after the surgery) respectively and the knee joint samples were harvested for detection. Safranin-O/fast green staining was performed to examine the morphology of articular cartilage. The expressions of type II collagen (Col2A1), aggrecan-1 (Agc1), matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) mRNAs were evaluated by real-time fluorescent quantitation polymerase chain reaction. Histological analysis showed that the structure of articular cartilage was seriously destroyed in rats in the untreated group. On the contrary, the degenerative changes of the articular cartilage in the YQHYR group were dropped off. Real-time fluorescent quantitation polymerase chain reaction showed that expressions of Agc1, TIMP-1 and Col2A1 mRNAs were up-regulated in 6- and 10-month-old rats in the YQHYR group as compared with those in the untreated group (P<0.01, P<0.05), but there was no significant difference in expression of MMP-13 mRNA between the YQHYR group and the untreated group. The expression of Agc1 mRNA was up-regulated and the expression of MMP-13 mRNA was down-regulated in the 8-month-old rats in YQHYR group as compared with those in the untreated group (P<0.01). YQHYR can promote the synthesizing of aggrecan and type II collagen in chondrocytes and delay articular cartilage degradation in OA rats.']]"

The aim of this study was to explore the influence of miR-210 on type II collagen (Col II) and aggrecan expression and possible mechanisms in human degenerated nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Our results showed that miR-210 levels were significantly increased in degenerated NP tissues compared with healthy controls, and positively correlated with disc degeneration grade. By gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in human degenerated NP cells, miR-210 was shown to inhibit autophagy and then upregulate MMP-3 and MMP-13 expression, leading to increased degradation of Col II and aggrecan. Autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7) was identified as a direct target of miR-210. Knockdown of ATG7 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated the effects of miR-210 inhibitor on MMP-3, MMP-13, Col II and aggrecan expression. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-210 inhibits autophagy via silencing of ATG7, leading to increased Col II and aggrecan degradation in human degenerated NP cells.']""]]"
